The below should be applied at realm level, with possible divergence (-1, +1) at province level.

| Scale | Era                      | Technology                                                                                                                       | Magic                                                                                                                                                             | Political                                                                                                            |

| 1     | Ancient                  | Weapons are generally spears or short bronze swords with light armour prevalent.                                                 | Extremely Rare: Either revered or feared. Mages are generally naturally born and treated as manifestations of a deity or killed on sight.                         | Mostly an agrarian society with few cities that centralise political and religious power.                            |
| 2     | Classical                | Weapons and armour have evolved and medium armour is common, heavy armour is rare.                                               | Mostly Rare. Druids, Shamans, and other mages are around but shunned despite the good they may do for the community, superstition and fear still surrounds magic. | Empires have consolidated power, or a fall of a great empire fractures the land politically with a common culture.   |
| 3     | Medieval                 | Classic fantasy, all weapons & armour are available.                                                                             | Rare. While it is uncommon for a mage to be killed outright, the use of magic in common areas is taboo.                                                           | Small communities support larger countries on a fractured political landscape.                                       |
| 4     | Renaissance              | Information and technology begin to become a part of everyday life. Firearms revolutionise warfare.                              | Consolidated. Mages are collected and trained by the powerful. Court mages advise rulers or the mage could rule.                                                  | Continental Empires subjugate less advanced cultures for resources and power projection.                             |
| 5     | Industrial               | Speed of communication and travel increase. Standardised firearms have made armour obsolete.                                     | Specialised. Magic is practiced in the open but few are trained in its use. Mages are an elite part of society. Other planes are visited but not well understood. | The inward focus of large power blocks as philosophers, mages/scientists experiment with social systems and culture. |
| 6     | Modern / Post-industrial | Near-instant communication and continental travel are common. The evolution of warfare brings casualties to unimaginable levels. | Uncommon. Prestige and power are associated with magic. Only the rich or powerful are commonly taught magic. Other planes are being studied by specialists.       | Application of social theories in the previous level. Global hegemonies established.                                 |
| 7     | Atomic                   | Comfort and well-being above all. Warfare evolves to be more specialised. Global travel is common.                               | Common. Magic is in everyday life making things easier. Most families have at least one mage. Other planes are well understood.                                   | Social, economic, and political intrigue between a few hegemonies plays out on a global stage.                       |
| 8     | Information              | Entertainment and communication are instantaneous. Warfare includes affecting societal pressure and economics.                   | Generalized. Magic-infused items are required to live. Golems and constructs are mass-produced. Other planes are being visited by everyone.                       | Ideologies begin to erase borders and the population moves towards a world without nations.                          |

> Generally speaking, Technology and Magic should be the indicator for the Political scale. The political should be somewhere in between the technology and magic levels with a bias towards the higher number.
> 
> It is crucial to keep in perspective the political and societal ramifications of magic and technology. When WorldCrafting, consistency is essential. A setting’s political background and upkeep should match the societal structures that support your themes. The other side of this is establishing governmental archetypes to fit the story’s theme you’re crafting.
> 
> Mages at the low end of the Magic scale (1-3) should be treated differently. Public use of magic could be banned or just taboo. Those practicing evil magic or using unseemly components could be burned alive or imprisoned for their crimes. Magic is generally viewed with a superstitious eye. This could be because a powerful sorcerer in recent memory waged war on the world or because magic is so foreign that people fear it. Power Mages may quickly rise to powerful positions, enchanting or killing their way to subjugating rivals. One could see the Pharaohs of Egypt originally being sorcerers to convince the people that they were gods. Even in classical Greek stories, city-states wouldn’t go to war without the blessing of a soothsayer, but they wouldn’t keep one in the city for fear of bad omens. History is full of inspiration for magic in your world-building.
> 
> Magic becomes more acceptable and generalised in the mid-scale (4-7). Minor spells cast in public are acceptable to most people. Similar to how the Samurai and Knights held a particular political class in society, the Mages in these scales would have special privileges that many common folks don’t enjoy. The higher on the scale your setting goes, the less unique the Mage becomes. This will mean that while most mages are landowners and accountable to the sovereign at level four. They hold no significantly special place in society at level 7. Similar to the way Knights were made obsolete by the longbow and firearms, the commoner mage eliminates the need to control mages through feudal means.
> 
> The most important thing to remember is that the application of the scales within the setting you’re crafting needs to be consistent. Give careful thought and consideration to the consequences of having high technology and low magic, or the opposite. How would the rulers of a centralised state political system look to leverage the talents of the magically inclined (Full Metal Alchemist)? If magic and technology are both at a reasonably advanced state, what are the reasons that technology wasn’t hindered by the presence of magic?
