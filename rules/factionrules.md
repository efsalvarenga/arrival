## Faction Turns, Trouble, and Conflict

Factions do things during the faction turn. It's usually safe to run a faction turn once per game month, though in times of great excitement it might be run more often, or less often for larger factions that don't change with the rapidity of a village in motion. The GM decides when it's time to run a faction turn and what factions should act during it.

Factions act in random order each turn. Every turn, the faction can perform one internal action affecting their own internal state of affairs, and one or more external actions affecting their neighbours. A faction can take as many external actions in a turn as they have Power, but they can't use more than one action on a specific neighbour in a turn.

Some actions require Trouble checks. To make a Trouble check, roll the faction's action die. If the number rolled is greater than the faction's Trouble score, it passes the check. If equal or less, it fails. You can compare the roll to the faction's list of Problems to find out which Problem was instrumental in causing the check to fail, or simply pick an appropriate one to blame.

Other actions require Contests between factions. For a Contest, each faction rolls their action die and the higher score wins, with ties going to the higher-Power faction, or the defender if both are equal.
