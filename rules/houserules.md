# Rules adopted for Arrival

## Rest

As proposed on Gritty Realism (DMG267), only valid for HP recovery - all other recovery maintains original rest times. 
- Short rests (so that you can heal a number of hit dices) changes from 1h to 8h.
- Long rests (so that you can fully recover HP and hit dices) changes from 8h to 7 days. 
- Elven trance is half of the short/long rest for HP and hit dice purposes.

## Damage and Injury

- On a critical hit, the target makes a CON saving throw. In case of failure, a lingering injury is set. As proposed on Injuries (DMG272).

## Life expectancy

- Elves live up to 3000 years. Some even longer - and there are tales that in the past elves were actually immortal (like on LotR).
- All other races are maintained.

## Characters' death (or retirement)

- If a character dies, or if the player decides to retire their character, a new character will be built with half the average level of the rest of the party (always rounded down to the lowest integer, i.e.: floor of number).

## Hit points when leveling

- Characters gain the standard hit points as shown on the PHB + CON modifier.

## Sanity and madness

Characters would run Sanity check, as opposed to arcana or history when dealing trying to comprehend history or effects of deities (think of Cthulhu Mythos here). But characters would also have to run a saving throw for Sanity (like any other saving throw) when in presence of a mind crashing effect of these creatures (think of Cthulhu again :)). On a failed save, one point of sanity is lost and one madness is given.

My suggestion is we use the DMG rules as I explained (not exactly what is in the book, but simpler), with the alternative table of madness, and this new table for ST DCs.

The rule is the simplified DMG rule for sanity (WIS + INT + 11) / 3 rounded up as the Sanity ability. We would use checks as described in the DMG, with the DC on the table I published here. For fails you lose a point. You regain with magic or treatment.

## Learning new languages

As there will be many languages in Guemenos, we need to expand a bit the rule of learning languages from the PHB (https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#Training). We will use as follows:
- **Dissimilar languages** (i.e. languages from different cultures that do not share a close culture lineage | 2+ links): Takes 4 quarters minus the intelligence modifier in quarters (minimum 1). Any racial language will be considered a dissimilar language.
- **Similar languages** (i.e. languages from different cultures that share a close culture lineage | 1 link): Takes 6 months minus the intelligence modifier in months (minimum 1). 
- **Dialects and official languages** (i.e. languages from the same culture or official language for the region you are): Takes 8 weeks minus the intelligence modifier in weeks (minimum 1).

Learning a language can be accomplished either by being immersed in a new language (free learning time and money -wise), or by having a tutor (8h/day, 1gp/day - downtime activity). 

## Skill usage

I've separated application of skills in 4 types: physical, perceptive, social and knowledge. There is probably some edge cases, but I think these four covers most of it. Each skill might be applied in one of more way as well - we decide on the table. This is not standard rule, but will help me come up with a system for applying skill checks (DMs will see that D&D leaves a lot undecided there).

- **Physical**: only used when actively doing something. Players have to describe intention and approach. Passive checks (reflexes) are done using saving throws. E.g.: Acrobatics, Athletics, Sleigh of hand, Stealth, Tool proficiencies.
- **Perceptive**: are always **on** passively, against which DCs are checked. Players can actively choose to use them as well - which will call for a dice roll (unless DC is impossible). Intention and approach must be described by the player for using the skill actively. E.g.: Animal handling, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Survival
- **Social**: are always **on** passively, against which DCs are checked. If a passive check is not enough to succeed, the GM might call for a roll (unless DC is impossible). Intention and approach will be assumed by the GM when using passively (i.e. it is expected sometimes the GM will assume them wrongly). This assumption by the GM is a trade-off tool we will use to avoid going off-character often ([more detail on social skills](https://tabletopjoab.com/how-and-when-to-use-dd-social-skills/)). E.g.: Deception, Intimidation, Performance, Persuasion.
- **Knowledge**: in general are always **on** passively (i.e. all the time the GM describes something a PC recognises). The players can also ask questions with regards the knowledge of their character any time - which will trigger a dice roll (unless it is clearly a success or impossible). Knowledge skills can also be used in long active actions, which requires description of intention and approach (i.e. research, rationalising about something the PC has experienced, documenting findings, etc). E.g., but not only, Arcana, History, Religion, sometimes Medicine, Animal Handling, Tools (even acrobatics could be checked this way, from a knowledge perspective).

N.B. 1: For rules on scores for passive checks refer to PHB175.
N.B. 2: During combat, using any skill is an action (also somewhere in the PHB).

## Combat actions

1. We run initiative, we track initiative and AC on the table (a player helps the GM)
2. At the beginning of each turn the GM briefly describes the scene as it stands (tokens are used sparingly as they reduce the speed of combat - theatre of the mind is the default)
3. Players are responsible to prepare for their round (players don't need to pay full attention to other players actions - just get a jist of it - as this simulates better a real combat). Players that are not ready to describe their character's action almost imediatly (up to 10 seconds for next session, 2 seconds less per session until we reach 2 seconds, and then 1 second) will have their round pushed to the end of the turn - and if indecision is not solved by the end of the turn, they automatically take a dodge action.
4. Players declare what they do, roll and compare with AC themselves, and describe the outcome (can be brief, but made dramatic on criticals). Damage is run.
5. GM describe the actions of all NPCs
6. Sometimes between rounds, on the same turn, the GM will need to update the scene (when something big changes, e.g. an area effect, someone falling, etc)


## Travel rules

## Environment conditions

### Thunderstorm

- Visibility: The combined effects of precipitation and wind reduce visibility by three quarters, imposing a -8 penalty on Spot, Search, and Listen checks.
- Ranged attacks: Thunderstorms make ranged weapon attacks impossible, except for those using siege weapons, which suffer a -4 penalty on attack rolls.
- Light: Thunderstorms automatically extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. They cause protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and have a 50% chance to extinguish these lights.
- Wind:
	- Creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Fort save or be blown away (Tiny or smaller creatures; knocked prone and rolled 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of non-lethal damage per 10 feet), knocked down (Small; prone), or checked (Medium; unable to move forward against the force of the wind).
	- Airborne creatures are instead blown back 2d6 x 10 feet and dealt 2d6 points of non-lethal damage due to battering and buffeting (Small or smaller creatures), blown back 1d6 x 10 feet (Medium), or blown back 1d6 x 5 feet (Large).
- In addition, thunderstorms are accompanied by lightning that can pose a hazard to characters without proper shelter (especially those in metal armour). As a rule of thumb, assume one bolt per minute for a 1-hour period at the centre of the storm. Each bolt causes electricity damage equal to 1d10, DC 15 DEX ST reduces to half. 
- An unprotected character in cold weather must make a **Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, + 1 per previous check) or take 1d6 points of non-lethal damage**. A character who has the Survival skill may receive a bonus on her saving throw and may be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well.
- A character who takes any non-lethal damage from cold or exposure is beset by frostbite or hypothermia (treat her as fatigued). These penalties end when the character recovers the non-lethal damage she took from the cold and exposure.
- Non-lethal damage from cold or exposure cannot be recovered until the character gets out of the cold and warms up again. Once a character is rendered unconscious through the accumulation of non-lethal damage, the cold and exposure begins to deal lethal damage at the same rate.
