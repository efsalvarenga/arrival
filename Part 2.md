## Glasrath mountains


### Factions

Ghuse will climb to power every time based on faction code (current simulation):



1. Turf > 3: starts having large festivities celebrating Algath: ¼ of the leadership and population is in full support.
2. Turf > 6: number of undead greatly surpasses the number of alive people (2-to-1), mostly working the mines: ½ of the leadership (lowest turf factions) and population is in full support - if characters haven't noticed yet, they notice now, that people are looking more pale and seem a bit brain drained.
3. Turf > 9: known people from the first days of the alliance are raised, including the dragon and Fuko - ¾ of the leadership and population is in full support.
4. Turf = 12: the alliance is now Ghuse's, and he turns to his Aivrindyt form now.

How PCs can slow down Ghuse's ascension:



* If they actively foil Ghuse, Ghuse's tenacity is reduced
* If they actively strengthen one of the other factions, their tenacity is increased
* If they appoint a new leader (from outside the current alliance), another faction can be created and take over some of the turf
* If they kill Ghuse/Aivrindyt.


### Locations



* 


## Linhe


### Factions

Linhe is important as it is the last unconquered province of the north desert. Both FFKA and the Mercian take this conquest seriously, but neither wants to escalate it to military or clearly hostile action.

# Background & secrets



* Segarus FFKA East Chapter capitan is nosy on the character if they get to red tower: Intent is to claim the destruction of Gellert if PCs do it. For that he might appoint a knight to go with PCs (as spy).
* Ghost cavalry (Nazgul) protects access to the NE port to the other dimension for evil
* ophaire = avernus (1st level of hell)
* Spawn plague (Vampire) has started in Throtha
* secret buried in the Holzanger castle - FFKA with a pact with an evil God created the ghost riders for this god, in exchange for influence in the continent
* immortal men from the past come from the west, dwarves and elves from the east
* [Arcane] A black dragon was seen wandering the Ghost Domain close to the Ammuinoth tunnel fractures
* [Arcane] This confluence and pooling of energy is all but unique in the Castle of Holzanger, and it’s the most closely guarded secret about the site. The only way for low-level characters to uncover a bit of arcane history this esoteric would be to spend at least a month in research at one of the great libraries of the continent — or a few hours in the Arcane Scriptorium beneath the citadel.
* Olivepia is where the head of the Faletist church sits. It is a religious empire with a strong hand on neighbour empires (other empires are vassals)
* The very large desert was created in one of the wars with the very old wars with the gods. And, They got from, from the south. Consure that. World scale wall of fire. And in the region, we're now is the cold desert used to be a code. Very cold, forest temple forest with streams of water, and rivers, and everything. But the column the column of fire Was burning for a hundred years and all the entire planet in the entire planet. That's trip is a desert barren desert. It was the No Man's Land from the battle of the, of the gods.
