Travel to [templeMystra](../locations/templeMystra.md) (while reading the [BookOfKnowledge](../objects/BookOfKnowledge.md)?)

> [!example] Situations

**Travel game**
- Visit cities of [eyaram](../locations/eyaram.md), [gimorkoc](../locations/gimorkoc.md) or [redtower](../locations/redtower.md)
	- Eyaram and Red Tower are taken by the [mercians](../factions/mercians.md)
	- Gimorkoc is taken by the [turnskull](../factions/turnskull.md)
- [ ] Update cities in the way: [eyaram](../locations/eyaram.md), [gimorkoc](../locations/gimorkoc.md) and [redtower](../locations/redtower.md)

**[holzanderCastle](../locations/holzanderCastle.md)**
- Undead took over [holzanderCastleL1](../locations/holzanderCastleL1.md)
- Oozes start to take over [holzanderCastleL2](../locations/holzanderCastleL2.md), and undead are coming too.

**Book of Knowledge, expected questions:**
- **How to wake up [Gaelira](../npcs/Gaelira.md)**: Not only a Dragon-King, but other Sorcerer-Kings from that age might also have the required psionic power. And there is one leading Turnskull. They are in the factory.
- **[ngar-tho](../../_gm/statblocks/ngar-tho.md) physiology**: They require moist locations, weakened by dryness and sunlight.

**Encounter Filarion or Hermits Crevasse**
[FilarionPapetor](../npcs/FilarionPapetor.md) (or [hermitsCrevasse](../locations/hermitsCrevasse.md)) represents the last remnants of local defenders, driven on by the [Akrasiel](../npcs/Akrasiel.md). They tried to steal [Akrasiel](../npcs/Akrasiel.md)'s sword, but left it behind in their retreat which they desperately need, and they appeal to the PCs to aid them. In exchange, they'll pass on information about a Place that offers a good way to get at the Antagonist without wading through their entire army.
- **Antagonists**: [Akrasiel](../npcs/Akrasiel.md)
- **Friends**: Do-gooder bandit chief who raids hostile forces [FilarionPapetor](../npcs/FilarionPapetor.md)
- **Places**: [CastleTerror](../locations/CastleTerror.md) and the defenders camp in the [hermitsCrevasse](../locations/hermitsCrevasse.md)
- **Complications**: The local community has been wrecked in fighting
- **Things**: [Akrasiel](../npcs/Akrasiel.md)'s sword
- **Tension**: Akrasiel hunts Filarion 

**Encounter Twilight Halls**
[twilightHallsAsylum](../locations/twilightHallsAsylum.md)

**City Encounter**
[EmanuelWeiss](../npcs/EmanuelWeiss.md) has been here for some time, and a his Turnskull constructs (Mob Small 20 HD) are polluting their land with their maintenance, making life almost unliveable for the locals. They're secretly smuggling in a Thing to help them survive, but [Eleni](../npcs/Eleni.md) discovers that their plan is being leaked by a traitor, and if help isn't found soon, the Antagonist will have both the Thing and the ringleaders of the resistance.
- **Antagonists**: Turnkskull officer [EmanuelWeiss](../npcs/EmanuelWeiss.md)
- **Friends**: Merchant whose trade routes have been cut by war [Eleni](../npcs/Eleni.md)
- **Places**: Military camp with soldiers and camp followers
- **Complications**: The army is bringing a great sickness or plague
- **Things**: Secret detector for [acrisae](../factions/acrisae.md) manoeuvres. The detector was built in [twilightHallsAsylum](../locations/twilightHallsAsylum.md)
- **Why important**: It's the only good approach to a soft target in the rear
- **Tension**: Pollution builds up, Emmanuel gets sick

**Encounter with sapient that relates that a flood that drowned out a community**
- ***Seed:*** **Mayor or [linhe_city](../locations/linhe_city.md), incompetent ruler who thinks only of their own safety** is working to seize **the Rainmaker's Curse** left behind by its now-dead collectors from the **Bastion tower, now left in ruins by the calamity** where it was left, but the **[ffkaEast](../factions/ffkaEast.md) leaders were somehow blamed for the disaster's intensity** and their allies are preventing them from getting through. Unfortunately, the strain of holding back the Antagonist **Incompetent ruler who thinks only of their own safety** them unable to get the **the Rainmaker's Curse** themselves, and the **Incompetent ruler who thinks only of their own safety** may soon overwhelm them.

**Mercians will try again to make the PCs wanted and have the FFKA hunting them down.**

> [!check] Treasure

**Cryptic & Exotic**: Does not look like treasure, and is not common here. **Artistic curtains.**
- **Origin**: Tribute to the owner from minions or vassals
- **Bulk**: Attached. The treasure is an object that is physically attached to some part of the architecture, and something bad will happen if it's pried loose.
- **Defences**: Behind a door or barrier only the owner can pass
- **Interested**: Its former owner, a denizen of the ruin
