> [!abstract] Character motivations
> - **Dolman**: Save Galiera (maybe take her from the castle), free Fuko from Ghuse, make a pact with Kimbarak.
> - **Guilf**: Find out more about The Void, and why it is so dark, and why his mother sold his soul. Understand why the Mercians are coming to Linhe.
> - **Amyria**: Protect little Guilf, find the Angel Hound and free her, destroy the 3 devices in the castle.

> [!warning] Intro
> - Summary of previous chapters
> - Sleigh of hand for congealed paradox
> - Regain sanity with delirium 
> - Maiming wound on Dolman 

> [!danger] Strong start
> **DERRO ARE ALL WEAK AND NUTS**
> 
> **Parlay with Gilsfeyr, the Camazotz leader (LOOK AT NOTES ON BOOK TOO)**
> - **PCs must now reach Imortra, as she has been waiting for them and she is impacient**
> - The only reason the derro tolerate [imortra](arrival/npcs/imortra.md) presence is fear of her and the [ngar-tho](_gm/npcCodex/statblocks/ngar-tho.md), and they’re terrified of her unseen overlord Gellert the Gruesome.
> - They hate the fungus-growers under Kurgorom think the bat cultists are maniacs who’ll be torn apart and eaten by their beloved bats eventually
> - The derro aren’t here as guards.
> - What happened with Bijnar
> - Gilsfeyr is intrigued by the appearance of powerful outsiders who could upset the local balance of power in his favour.
> - **Gilsfeyr are happy to help the PCs kill Imortra** and would help, provided they also wipe out the other band of derro.
> 	- they will have their weapons sack left in the same room and ways to release themselves.
> 	- If agreed, the Deepfolk might also be convinced to give them safe passage above after they have completed their task
> 	- **the notion they should honor a promise to outsiders barely registers**

> [!example] Potential scenes
> **DERRO ARE ALL WEAK AND NUTS**
> 
> **Parlay with Kurgorom, the village leader (LOOK AT NOTES ON BOOK TOO)**
> - Kurgorom wants to partner with Gilsfeyr until Imortra is taken down, from there she intends to raid the cultists (she does not tell the second part).
> - She would consider bringing a few friendly deepfolk to assist in the fight, but only a couple - otherwise Imortra might realise something odd is on.
> - Maybe PCs could arrive there in armour?
> 
> **PCs are taken as fake prisoners to Imortra**
> - While in the room, one sanity check per PC (1d6 damage)
> 	- If fail: Suppressed memories (Ravenloft 75)
> - Their weapons and armour will be accessible, and their shackles are loosely closed (easy to open)
> - (If you are caught in armour/weapons, this will signal something is off)
> - **Imortra will be with the PCs in a while (to give players option to arm themselves)**
> - If PCs arm themselves, they need to pass a stealth DC 17, otherwise they will be stopped by Antinom
> 
> **Parley with Imortra**
> - If characters are found in armour/weapons, Imortra will bring hell on them (maybe except Guilf) first, before Parley
> - Imortra's plan: the PCs are the best components for Gellert's experiment, and she would love that they participate in it
> 	- Dolman can be the receiver for Kimbarak - The Void's breach of the legacy
> 	- Amyria can be the channel for the Angel Hound's power, finally draining it to complete the experiment
> 	- Guilf can finally rejoin his mother once Makab is back, after the violence that Sergarus applied to their family
> - The Derros are just components she keeps around. When she needs one, she harvest them and rewrite the memory of others
> - If an agreement is not met, the characters will be shackled again (maybe a fight is required)
> - Imortra is an ancient, accomplished, proud, and malevolent elf. She is dedicated to protecting her mentor Gellert the Gruesome
> 
> ### If PCs sleep
> - Some dream about Kimbarak, Thalia, Mr. Void
> - Then some experiments 
> **Alchemist furnace leaks uncreation now**
> - Weird uncreated oozes have begin to take over the second level
