- ***Seed:*** **Mayor or Linhe, incompetent ruler who thinks only of their own safety** is working to seize **the Rainmaker's Curse** left behind by its now-dead collectors from the **Bastion tower, now left in ruins by the calamity** where it was left, but the **FFKA leaders were somehow blamed for the disaster's intensity** and their allies are preventing them from getting through. Unfortunately, the strain of holding back the Antagonist **Incompetent ruler who thinks only of their own safety** them unable to get the **the Rainmaker's Curse** themselves, and the **Incompetent ruler who thinks only of their own safety** may soon overwhelm them.

**Weird mutated/uncreated oozes have begun to take over the second level**

**Sanity check scenes at level 4, if around Ngar'tho (1 in 6 per day, or certain when close to Imortra)**
