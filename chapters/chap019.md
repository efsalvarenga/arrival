**Deja-vu rooms**
- If **rolled 1 in 6**, the real room is seen. The real rooms always have Ngar'tho working on them. They are always pacific, if not disturbed - and would be **keen to explain their experiments.** The rooms purposes can be:
	- laboratories 
	- surgery rooms
	- prison habitats
	- a person with all systems segregated in the walls - that can talk!! - wife of whitley
	- lead pendulums in bottles (scarface, long tom, mike) that shake answering chats with the Ngar'tho 
	- VR machines
	- experiment with Derro babies
	- an open Ngar'tho (baby with a lot of evourec tentacles)
	- evourec preserves
	- incubation dome
	- brain sinapse libraries
	- experiment with humanoids and machines
	- complete alien rooms, etc
	- **real room 524 CAN ONLY APPEAR AFTER THE PCS HAVE FREED THALIA FROM THE SPHERE (SHE GOES INTO AMYRIA, who gains 1 level worth of xp) is the chamber of the god brain (Ravenloft 73)**
		- the room is much larger than what is in the map, 1d4+4 Ngar'tho attending to vampiric evourecs that are then attached to undead bodies to create Lady Scurvy who are then thrown in the river.
		- Kimbarak **golden dagger** is found on Dolmans hand, and Mr Void asks Dolman to open a rift in the legacy by sacrificing Guilf while the Ngar'tho hold Amyria.
	- **in the case of a real room, if there is a staircase it leaves the level (up or down)**
- If rolled 2-6 in 6, the same rooms contain the creatures and treasures described in the book, use the same roleplay and dialogue as well
	- **ALWAYS ROLL REACTION IN A ROOM**
	- ***Except*** for Gellert's rooms, which are marked by overlays which ones are real
	- If using augmented reality then all stairs are the real deal.
- Stairs up and down
	- **Goes up -** stairs: 501 (1-2 in 6), 512 (3-4 in 6), 509 (5-6 in 6); hole: 505
	- **Goes down -** stairs: 514 (1-2 in 6), 506 (3-4 in 6), 507 (5-6 in 6)

**When PCs ==sleep== on L4 and below**
- Sanity check, if someone fails:
	- Account for food (there are mushrooms and fish) and water (from the river?, from the walls, etc..)
	-  Add 1d4 months of elapsed world time for each failed test per PC, per day of rest
	- For PCs that failed:
		- Dream of experiments (Ravenloft)
		- Dreams of eternity living in tunnels eating mushrooms and drinking the water from the river
		- Some communication with [aivridyt](arrival/npcs/aivridyt.md) ("Yes Algath my master?"), thinking the PCs are Algath
- Once 6 months have passed in total, an year: Perception check DC 18 - you seem much dirtier than you would be and aging.
- Once 12 months have passed DC 15 check
- Once 18 months, automatic success

**Meeting with [Gellert](../npcs/Gellert.md)**
- Gellert wants the characters to proceed down to level  6 and investigate “the disturbances” there for him.
- What he really wants is to magically observe as the characters are destroyed by elemental forces and the sphere of annihilation in the hope of learning something from that
- Gives: flying balm (one per character) and wafers of warmth (two per character; see the appendix for both)
- After Gellert’s proposal, raise your hand with all five fingers extended. Slowly lower one finger at a time where all players can see the countdown. If you reach zero before characters clearly agree to Gellert’s terms, wave your hand in a motion of dismissal. The characters are instantly teleported away - **teleported to a room 503 without the furnishings**
- **Final encounter:** they’ll infuriate him by killing the voidling on Level 6 and destroying the sphere of annihilation. If the latter happens, they won’t need to attack Gellert; he ambushes them when they return to the Black River. Gellert doesn’t pursue characters if they retreat to the howling halls or escape up to the bat caverns
- Look at room 503 [holzanderCastleL5](holzanderCastleL5.md)

**Fight with [Imortra](../npcs/Imortra.md)'s people**
- Each Derro faction roll a reacion. 8 or more they join the fight.
- If deepfolk are brought down they will join the fight with high morale.
- Characters are not supposed to be killed, they are required.
- After the fight, if characters loose, they are subject to experiments: Metamorphica 222 Test subjects (we roll together).
