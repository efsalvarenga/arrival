We are glad you have all agreed and have started the ritual. When is time, come to the chamber of Makab.

> [!example] Potential Scenes

**Fight with [Imortra](../npcs/Imortra.md)'s people**
- Imortra will not allow the PCs to leave, and will have the creatures in her floor make sure it does not happen.
- Each Derro faction roll a reacion. 8 or more they join the fight.
- If deepfolk are brought down they will join the fight with high morale.
- Characters are not supposed to be killed, they are required.
- After the fight, if characters lose, they are subject to experiments: Metamorphica 222 Test subjects (we roll together).

**Book of knowledge to Amyria, and the three rings**
- [Gellert](../npcs/Gellert.md) can make 3 rings, one for each PC. Amyria's ring will be her intellect connect with the Book of Knowledge.

**Meet with Lagfel**
- [Lagfel](../npcs/Lagfel.md) can be an ally to leave the castle unharmed as particules, but he cannot go unless The Void exists or not in the world - the current duality locks Lagfel's departure.
- Lagfel is happy if Gellert is destroyed. He does not mind the Ngar'tho. He will be imensily grateful if the PCs either summon, or destroy Mr Void.

**The Ngar'tho will not attack the PCs**
- But they have Galliera as a hostage, if the PCs do not complete their end of the contract for the ritual.
- Thalia will never leave the castle, unless Mr Void is summoned.
- Whatever the PCs do is considered part of the ritual by the hive mind of the [ngar-tho](../../_gm/statblocks/ngar-tho.md)
- [Deja-vu rooms](chap019.md#Deja-vu%20rooms)
