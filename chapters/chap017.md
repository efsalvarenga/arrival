## Intro

- Summary of Chapter 16

## Character motivations

- **Dolman**: Find Galiera, free Fuko from Ghuse, make a pact with Kimbarak.
- **Guilf**: Find out more about The Void, and why it is so dark, and why his mother sold his soul. Understand why the Mercians are coming to Linhe.
- **Amyria**: Protect little Guilf, find the Angel Hound and free her, feels the Holzander castle is her "call to action". Investigate what is causing the Uncreation.

## Strong start

**Lady scurvy encounter at night**
- Roll for distance and surprise
- Attempt to drink sapience: i.e.:
	- Round 1: mind blast and attack+grapple in round one
	- Round 2: mind blast and drink sapience - **Notice check to see that the umbilicals/uncreation glows as it drinks sapience**
- If successful will run (trying to carry the PC, but letting go if needed)

```encounter
creatures:
  - 1: Lady Scurvy
```

## Potential scenes

**Encounter with sapient that relates that a flood that drowned out a community**
- ***Seed:*** An **Incompetent ruler who thinks only of their own safety** is working to seize **A cursed magical item that's calling forth the disaster** left behind by its now-dead collectors from the **Once-splendid building left in ruins by the calamity** where it was left, but a **Local somehow blamed for the disaster's intensity** and their allies are preventing them from getting through. Unfortunately, the strain of holding back the Antagonist **Incompetent ruler who thinks only of their own safety** them unable to get the **A cursed magical item that's calling forth the disaster** themselves, and the **Incompetent ruler who thinks only of their own safety** may soon overwhelm them.

- Imortra knows the PCs are coming, set up the deepfolk to take them prisioners
- Sixteen sorrows - natural disaster: Linhe becomes the Bluetspur Aratu: how do arratu works with the legacy?
- Deepfolk put Galiera on top of pile of rubble - it is a trap to get Dolman to complete the ritual: check bluespur
- Deepfolk change in approach now!
	- They should not be in chase / guerrilla fights anymore.
	- They set a trap with Galiera now?? Imortra knows they want her, so it is good like this...
	- The deepfolk are to imprision them and they a Derro will pick them up
	- They will only act from their own level and, it required to chase characters, will do so in large groups.
	- The deepfolk are now separated in a more violent group, and in a group that is more interested in negotiating with the PCs - define which is which and their locations. 
- Party finds Galiera, she is barely alive and needs professional care (minimally in Mystra's Temple)
	- She has a d10 usage dice days of life in her. After a day is passed, roll the die and in a 1 or 2, reduce the die size.
	- Galiera shield is left in the landing of level 3. Galiera is taken from level 3 to Imortra's level. She lived there for years. The deepfolk are beaten and depressed. They will fight the PCs with low morale, all they want is to flee Imortra now. Morale check is 8 now. Unless Dolman's mind is not read.
- Party tries to negotiate with the Deepfolk
	- There are lost treasures on the clacking caverns that they would like to have.
	- One of these treasures is Kimbarak's Helm
- Deepfolk want Kimbarak's hands
	- One small unit will follow the PCs for it. They might trade it for the PCs escape
- Weird mutated/uncreated oozes have begun to take over the second level
- Sanity check scenes:
	- River Styx
	- Memories
