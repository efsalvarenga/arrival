## Intro

- Summary of Chapter 16
- Account for rations
- Horror tables:
	- Dark visions
	- Encounter aberration 
	- Potion side effect

## Character motivations

- **Dolman**: Find Galiera, free Fuko from Ghuse, make a pact with Kimbarak.
- **Guilf**: Find out more about The Void, and why it is so dark, and why his mother sold his soul. Understand why the Mercians are coming to Linhe.
- **Amyria**: Protect little Guilf, find the Angel Hound and free her, feels the Holzander castle is her "call to action". Investigate what is causing the Uncreation.

## Strong start

**Lady scurvy encounter at night**
- Roll for distance and surprise
- Attempt to drink sapience: i.e.:
	- Round 1: mind blast and attack+grapple in round one
	- Round 2: mind blast and drink sapience - **Notice check to see that the umbilicals/uncreation glows as it drinks sapience**
- If successful will run (trying to carry the PC, but letting go if needed if hurt)

**Continue travel**
- Wandering encounter checks (1 in 6, r1 on the road, r2 in the wastelands):
	- Every day
	- Every night
	- Every foraging (DC 25)
- Survival checks with advantage (Amyria knows the desert) DC 15
- Travel pace: 4 miles/h on roads, 2 miles/h off roads

```encounter
creatures:
  - 1: Lady Scurvy
```

## Potential scenes

**Chat with Cagoth**
- Deepfolk were in turmoil for many days after Bijnar was killed. **He does not want to know if it were the PCs**.
- He explain the competition for leadership with the remaining lieutenants. He explains who are each, and also the Shamans.
	- Egail is a young hothead who wants only to kill enemies and gain glory.
	- Gostov looks up to Bjrnyar and respects his wisdom but also grows impatient with prolonged inactivity

**Deepfolk put Galiera on top of pile of rubble**
- It is a trap to get Dolman to complete the ritual to save The Void
- The plan is to get the PCs alive (and send them to the Derro at L4)
- Imortra knows the PCs are coming
- If needed, the Deep Folk will chase the PCs in a very large group - the PCs have to be captured this time **- all in!**
- Deepfolk morale checks with -2 penalty as they recently lost Bijnar - they are beaten and depressed.
- They hate Imortra, but are not aware the Derro also hate her.

**Party finds Galiera, she is barely alive and needs professional care (minimally in Mystra's Temple)**
- She has a d12 (E: 20) usage dice days of life in her. After a day is passed, roll the die and in a 1 or 2, reduce the die size.
- Galiera can make an effort to speak all the secrets she has uncovered, but that will cost 1d4 rolls on the usage dice.
