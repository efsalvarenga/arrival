## Intro

- Summary

## Character motivations

- **Dolman**: Find Galiera, free Fuko from Ghuse, make a pact with Kimbarak.
- **Guilf**: Find out more about The Void, and why it is so dark, and why his mother sold his soul. Understand why the Mercians are coming to Linhe.
- **Amyria**: Protect little Guilf, find the Angel Hound and free her, feels the Holzander castle is her "call to action". Go shopping.

## Strong start

- Fight the 3 phase spiders (or run to the city)
	- During the fight, an FFKA Tent hears the fight, and arrive to support in 1d4 rounds

## Potential scenes

- **Twice per evening/night**: 1 or 2 in 6 - Make one WIS/CHA save, each, against a Ngat'tho. Those who fail sees the fake vision, have their mind read and risk 1d6 sanity.
	- (1) A Deja-vu.
	- (2) A street where all the orthogonally aligned houses meet in the centre of the street and block the sun
	- (3) Children singing 
	- (Etc) Water going uphill, drawings appearing in walls...
	- *If Dolman's mind is read*, ***immediately***, Mr Void communicates with Guilf that they need to bring a dwarf to the Holzander Castle, to make a connection with Kimbarak and save his mother.
	- *If Amyria's mind is read, **immediately***, Mr Void communicates with Guilf that Amyria will be very happy to meet Thalia once more, in the Holzander Castle.
- Sergarus is in the city, with 7 tents in total, after the fall of [Gimorkoc](arrival/locations/gimorkoc.md) to the undead. The city is lost.
	- Sergarus intends to use [Eyaram](arrival/locations/eyaram.md) as a stronghold of the FFKA, until they figure out what to do with the umbilicals
	- Two tents were sent to the city of Linhe as scouts, and will send crows with information once they arrive there
	- FFKA is skeptical, they really think the problem is Glasrath now (they've investigated it)
- [Marcus](Marcus.md), that Amyria spoke about taking [Sergarus](arrival/npcs/Sergarus.md) out approaches her.
	- They will enact the plan next night, with help from 5 Rurkinar and the trader [Eleni](Eleni.md)
- [Eleni](Eleni.md) - Stationary trader, with a lot of produce from Glasrath to be sent to the rest of the realm. But now he is afraid of travelling and blames poor management of the troops by [Sergarus](arrival/npcs/Sergarus.md)
- Sergarus is curious with Guilf as he looks like the child he saved from their witch mother decades ago.
- Mercians spend their time in the Mercian house, where the PCs are not welcome.
	- Inside, in the underground floor, they are praying, and making music, and pleasures of the flesh, making tattoos, weaving clothes...
	- They speak highly of Imortra, their leader and 1st among equals of the council
	- They have a Lady Scurvy locked in a room underground
- Foreshadow the Siege of Lekar (Ravenloft 104).
- Final retreat through a tunnel in the upper quarter, that goes south for 3 miles, then goes to the surface and continues to a Ammuinoth tunnel (6 miles SE).
	- Mercians think the undead are part of the plan and go receive them - they are completely destroyed...
	- Requires sacrifice of a larger portion of the city (explosion?)
