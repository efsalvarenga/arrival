## Characters

### Motivations
- **Dolman**: Find Galiera, learn about her stone
- **Miraak**: Prove and learn about himself himself
- **Guilf**: Find and kill Sergarus
- **Amyria**: Libraries, libraries, books, books
- **Kethra**: Find the purple dragon

## Intro
- Babi will play the sorcerer or the archer?
- By the end of the session, or by Sunday evening, tell me what change in the world you want to do next

## Strong start 

### Mystra's Temple
- 8-day trip to get to Mystra's temple, where characters will rest and recover
- Location: [Mystra's Temple](../locations/templeMystra.md)
- Draw: Find the password for Mystra's door
- NPCs in the temple are: priests, cultists and traders (commoners)
- Consider having a [Thunderstorm](../rules/houseRules.md#Thunderstorm) 2d4 hours after leaving the temple

## Potential scenes 

### Rurkinar festival and ritual, and FFKA censoring
- *Awareness trigger*: As soon as arriving in the city, they see the tower of the temple and hear the movement of people towards it
- *Location*: A flooded monumental hall of brass, in terrible decay, with sweeping passageways encircled by a graveyard. The construction follows the [Iopothae](../context/secrets/secretsHistory.md#Iopothae) style.
- *Dramatic question*: which side will the PCs take, and how
- *Source of conflicts*: Arrival in one of the Linhe cities - Rukinar festival and ritual is happening, [FFKA](../factions/ffkaEast.md) is in position and ready to censor the cultists.
	- **Imortra (Guilf's mother) observing Guilf.**, Someone calls her by her name and she leaves for the Mercian house. If Guilf follows someone grabs him - what is this pert doing here?
	- The ritual finally completes in an unexpected way: the Angel Hound communicates with [Imra Advyre](../factions/rurkinar.md#^imraAdvyre) in imprisoned in the lost castle of the Holzander's.
	- Tense situation, FFKA wants to find reason to imprison cultists
	- [Sergarus](arrival/npcs/Sergarus.md) arrive in the next day to interrogate cultists.
	- Imra becomes troubled and mad.
	- *Something else has to create a problem - tbd at table.*

> **Mad poem about the staff**
> 
> *Mmm... the staff, the Thalia's one,
> It's got the power, oh yes, it's second to none,
> Lightning and thunder, its magic can stun,
> She imbued the gods, and their power she spun.
> 
> Thalia was an acolyte, young but wise,
> She brought the old pantheon to rise,
> Restored their strength with magic ties,
> And now she serves as an Angel in the skies.*

## Appendix

## Additional unlikely scenes

### H113 Catacombs and vision of the Ophaire
- Location: [Catacombs](../locations/holzanderCastle.md#Catacombs) (as set out in SC45)
- Threat: PCs may think there is something here, but except for the information of the Ophaire, there is nothing. 
- Conflicts: Incoming undead never stops - Keep adding foes as necessary to make this area a tough one. A rule of thumb, when combat starts roll a 1d4. That is the number of monsters that (if below), would trigger another incoming foe (from table below). When a new foe comes, roll again. And keep doing it.
- End conditions: The PCs realise there is nothing here for them.

| 1d12 roll | Outcome            |

### H208 (CR 2)

**Mention an invisible field in the air that somehow seizes onto and discorporates whatever it touches, like some sort of slow-acting stasis or disintegration field.** Active successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot it. Even then, it looks like an out-of-focus disturbance in the air, not a solid object.

![](https://i.imgur.com/55qmtZe.png)

When the dire gelatinous cube first starts its turn with 28 or fewer hit points, it reflexively strikes the cracked holding tank as a bonus action. This ruptures the tank and floods the room with ooze plasma. Every space from the top of the stairs to the door into Area 202 quickly becomes ankle-deep in ooze plasma, making it difficult terrain and dealing (2) 1d4 acid damage to every creature standing in the stuff at the start of their turn. The dire gelatinous cube heals 18 (4d4 + 8) hit points thanks to the infusion of plasma. In addition, every creature in that area when the tank is ruptured must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone as the corrosive plasma envelops their feet. The cube tries to engulf as many prone characters as possible, and prone characters attempt to save against the attack with disadvantage.

Finally, just because the cube is eventually killed doesn’t mean it stops being a threat. It can still block the passage (invisibly), and it’s still powerfully acidic to anyone and anything attempting to climb over it or squeeze through it.

### H211

Baska (Lasbascilag) - Ice Barbed Devil

### H216 Scriptorium

**Timeline destination (d10 roll)**

1. *27023 years in the past (1463 IT) Construction of the Ammuinoth.* The characters are in a natural cavern, with a single tunnel that goes east and ends in a wellbore opened to the surface above. Ancient Dwarves and Elves are building the Ammuinoth in the region.
	![](https://i.imgur.com/H3JoaRX.png)

2. 23521 years in the past (4523 IT) Awakening of the Kyri. The characters are in a natural cavern, with a single tunnel that goes east. The opening after the tunnel has a fully built Ammuinoth, with a passage to the surface. The construction utilises proto-seraphic engines and the existing upward wellbore has been vastly expanded expanded to the depths of the earth. The entire area has become an immense city with Dwarves and Elves that look more like Duergar and Drows, respectively.  
	![](https://i.imgur.com/hsBK26m.png)

3. *18009 years in the past (10567 IT), War for Guemenos.* The characters are in a natural cavern, with one single tunnel that goes north. Four savage-looking dwarves squat around a fire, roasting meat on sticks. The dwarves cry out in an difficult to recognise, guttural dwarvish language and grab stone-tipped spears lying in the dirt. If someone speaks with them in dwarvish they explain that a battle has been happening between two godly forces for the last 3000 years. If characters go through the tunnel, they can see scenes of the battle. 
	![](https://i.imgur.com/lr4R0as.png)

4. *9899 years in the past (18540 IT), After the Great Purge.* The characters are in a natural cavern, with one single tunnel that goes north. The cavern has been converted into a temple to Mammon, god of greed and madness. The room is swelteringly hot from an immense oven shaped like a monstrously fat humanoid that stands in the southern portion. Its open belly serves as the firebox, and flames within it are the only illumination. Six cultists and one cult fanatic in robes kneel before it. An orc, bound and gagged, lies on a table that can be tipped up to slide the orc into the blazing furnace. If characters do nothing, the sacrifice continues. If characters intervene, the cultists fight to the death. The freed orc is grateful but wants only to return to his village.
	![](https://i.imgur.com/pFtxutb.png)

5. *6512 years in the past (5181 GP), Passage to Arkul is opened.* The characters are in a natural cavern with a collapsed ceiling, with one single tunnel that goes north. The collapsed ceiling gives access the Ammuinoth. A flux of bright green high energy is going through the tunnels. The characters land in the midst of a battle between six duergar and two gricks. No matter who wins, they aren’t welcoming toward the party.
6. *498 years in the past (3377 NC), before the Great Depart.* The walls and furnishings of the library are ornate. Three elves are in the room, reading or sorting material on the shelves. They look at the characters with mild curiosity. They’ve seen the construct before, or at least heard about its rare appearances from previous caretakers of the scriptorium. This is the first time it’s been accompanied by anyone other than the clockwork servants, though these elves might not know that. How long the construct remains is up to you. The elves are friendly and willing to talk, but they won’t allow any material to be taken from their library. They speak only archaic Elvish (which is difficult to understand) and Draconic. Should the characters decide to get hostile, these elves use the stats of an archmage, an assassin, and a gladiator. When the construct fires up to leave, the elves quickly step out of its range and remain behind in their own time.
7. *1500 years in the future, realisation 982AC123.* The chambers are barely recognisable from their earlier features. The hole in the floor of Area 215 has been repaired. Area 218 has been converted into a throne room for a clockwork king attended by six clockwork soldiers (Creature Codex) and four courtiers (clockwork servants). They have, of course, heard tales of the shining blue deity that appeared briefly to their forebears generations ago but never imagined it would return in their runtimes. King Zakchi assumes the characters are the organic slaves of the time construct and the obviously superior clockwork servants, and he tends to ignore them or even become slightly offended if characters speak to him directly.
8. *15000 years in the future, realisation D358A-B Uncreated.* Doomsday has arrived, the characters are in the complete dark with only the floor around the construct holding them.
9. *50,000 years in the future, realisation 3.* Undead from the Drylands have taken control of the now unrecognisable area. A wight, a ghast, and three ghouls are prowling through the chambers. The architecture looks as if the whole place was sculpted from worm-eaten bone. Over its bulky armor, the wight wears grave-stained priestly robes of dark maroon with a bright red sash. It confronts the characters in Darakhul that has evolved to the point where it’s incomprehensible; it switches to nearly unintelligible Common if they don’t understand its first attempts. The wight-priest demands to know why the intruders defy the holy commands of Syrinx. It does not explain what this means, and if characters protest their innocence in any way, the undead attack in a righteous fury. More undead can join in if you want to up the ante.
10. *75,000 years in the future, realisation 789S.* By this time, the upper layers are gone, blasted away by some titanic cataclysm. The area is open to the sky, which is wreathed in sheets of perpetual green flame. The dominant life form is chuuls, and they’ve become considerably more intelligent over the millennia. Two chuuls stand nearby. Their stats are identical to standard chuuls except they have an Intelligence score of 24 and telepathy (240 feet). They are only momentarily perturbed by the arrival of the time construct and the characters. One of the chuuls issues a telepathic command to “surrender the devices and prepare for cranial cessation.” The other chuul levels a complex metal device about 9 feet long at the characters. The device is a lightning gun capable of shooting a lightning bolt every other round (100-foot line; 8d6 lightning damage; save DC 13; can be fired only by someone with chuul claws and telepathy).

### H217

- [cagothze](../npcs/cagothze.md)

### Arrival in Glasrath
- More alignment with Ghuse than before. Too many undead working on the mines. Trading is going well.
