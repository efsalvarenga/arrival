# Long timeline of Terra (beta)

## Silent Legions
***19th and 20th centuries AC***

First encounters with Outsiders on Earth. These encounters are rare, unobtrusive and mostly modest in scope. Early eldritch rituals and proto-psionic powers are discovered, but mostly unreliable.


## Golden Age of Men
***22nd to 27th centuries AC (swn120-127), Psionic and then Jump Gates powers apex***

Early spike drive space travel starts through shallow meta-dimensional courses, triggering the emergence of strong psionic powers in humans. Two centuries later, Psitech development enables jump gate space travel, leveraging deep meta-dimensional courses. Terran society reached its greatest expanse, possibly signalling its existence to ancient alien species. In its peak, development is broken by the first crisis - known as The Scream.


## Terra Dust
***27th to 32nd centuries AC***

Following The Scream, the majority of the worlds are severed from each other, with no working logistics and communications systems to integrate them. Human societies make what they can with degrading technologies. This was known as The Silence.

## Space Opera 

## Dark Sun
***One million years, Eldritch and then Cerulean powers apex***

In human societies, eldritch disciplines are now the relevant powers, with psionic powers left for pariahs and Outsiders - who are chased and killed. Several schools of magic prosper, one at a time. Each overcomes the previous one, reaches some kind of apex and then, somehow, trigger some universe control mechanism that starts new crises and dark ages. An unaccounted number of these cycles happened, and many of the schools of magic have been completely lost.

The end of the Sorcerer-Kings Era, known as the Cerulean Cycle, brought the age of Dragon-Kings, who were then able to fuse eldritch disciplines with psionic powers. These individuals were the most powerful of any other that ever existed, and were revered as gods by cults on the civilised city states on Earth. Their defiling magic consumed almost all life from the world, and a Second Silence age starts.


## Godbound
***200 millennia, Celestial and then Theotechnology powers apex***

The world is being populated with life again, and a few sorcerer-kings are able to re-establish some kingdoms. The last Dragon-King (Yurroi) breached Heaven, from where reality and meta-dimensional channels were operated. The kings searched for the creator of reality but found the throne empty. The celestial engines were operated by Angels, and in an act of fury the kings decided to vandalise Heaven. That did not go unpunished, and a war between the Angels and the Dragon-Kings ensued, culminating with the Earth scattered in pieces alongside uncreated reality. The universe was broken.

After the Dragon-Kings demise, other powerful sorcerers took their place, and used the stolen shards of heaven and eldritch rituals to weave the Made Gods. These divine powers finally uncreated Heaven itself. But with that, reality also became broken. Some Angels took lair in Earth itself, with most eventually waning in power and becoming proto-elves. A handful were able to maintain their power and proclaimed themselves as **The Edrahil**.


## The Legacy
***400 millennia***

A lot in unknown about this period, but what is known is that an ethereal race emerged on Earth, and were able to use their powers to weave a new fabric for reality and stitch the universe back together. This new fabric became known as The Legacy and the sorcerers who created it became known as The Weavers. The knowledge around the Legacy and its operation is buried in the Legacy itself, and mostly unknown to anyone.


## Outsider Rulers
***700 millennia***

The weakened humanity was overrun by waves of Outsider invasions, which conquered Earth one after the other. These Outsiders mostly battle amongst themselves, and humanity was driven to the deeps of Earth. During this era, a few remaining sorcerer-kings further their power through Outsider knowledge, and these became known as **The Kyri**.

The Outsider powers, in the end, were defeated by The Legacy, and most of these species fled Terra.


## Latter Earth
***Last 4 millennia***

Some celestial power attempted to break the Legacy, but some kind of defence protocol was activated. This became known as the Colligation of Time.


# Uncanny powers in the universe

## Primary disciplines

### Eldritch
***Traditional magic***

High magic, necromancy, etc. All of them channel universe energies similarly. Eldritch powers are known to be mostly accessible to humans and demihumans. The legacy is the current power responsible to maintain world realities in place, avoiding further uncreation. The original legacy writers are now gone, and knowledge on the legacy workings is mostly incomplete.

### Psionic
***Later developed into Psitech***

Originated in the golden age of man (possibly also in alien races), now mostly inaccessible to humans. Some ancient alien races can still operate Psitech to a limited extent. Some regions of latter earth have started developing this power again in a incomplete form through the school of the Wandering Crow.

### Celestial
***Reality engineering***

Originated by creatures known as Angels, in higher metadimensional spaces (heavens). Men first sight of it was during the invasion of heaven. Celestial is the technology what kept the metadimensional space in order, but it is currently mostly shattered. Only Angels fully understand it - and most of them do not care about worlds anymore.

## Derivative disciplines

### Cerulean
***Psionic and eldritch, the power of dragons***

Discipline in the age of the dragon-kings.

### Theotechnology
***Eldritch and Celestial***

Humans were able to bind celestial shards (stolen from the heavens) and Eldritch powers in creatures known as Made Gods. Legend speaks of sparks of Theotechnology awakening individuals (Godbounds).

### Jump gates
***Psionic and Celestial***

Ability to navigate deep metadimensions.

### Legacy
***All three powers***

Psitech to create the failsafe systems, celestial to create the engines, eldritch binds them.
