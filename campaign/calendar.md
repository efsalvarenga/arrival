# New Calendar

The New Calendar (NC) is defined as the years from the 8th Conclave from Nek. It is written as `Year-Month-Week-Day`. Each year has 10 months of 5 weeks each, and each week has 5 days. Each day has 25 hours.

The years are not defined based on translations around the sun, but rather a purely mathematical number. For this reason, although the NC is mostly used everywhere, many regions have additional calendars based on sun and moon time cycles. Nevertheless, the 25 hours day is defined based on daily cycles.

## Seasons

There are 4 seasons: Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn. They are defined by several cycles, which makes them difficult to predict:
- Translation of the solar system around the dark portal
- Translation cycle around the sun
- Planet pulsing energy
- Moon cycles, which emits shadow energy

The last documented season cycles are represented below.
