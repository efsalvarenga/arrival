- Beyond wall of sleep, Lovecraft 

## Hostile

**System: SWN (available for [free](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/230009/Stars-Without-Number-Revised-Edition-Free-Version))**
- SWN is an OSR system, which allows me to easily reskin a lot published materials since the 80s. Different than old school D&D, SWN has a much simpler class system, with most of the customisation done through background, foci (i.e. feats) and a robust skill system (based on classic Traveler - which is the skill system of the Hostile game too).
- For SWN I can easily convert any D&D adventure (any version, easier with up to 2e), and Call of Cthulhu (d100 systems) with some small work.
- Classes available: warrior, expert or mix/adventurer (i.e. no magic or psionic powers)

**Scenario: [Hostile](https://www.paulelliottbooks.com/hostile.html) **
- Link to [View-only PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fJPqFVlO9pqcjg7lMVgE9lAy4_vml6pW/view?usp=sharing).
- Gritty sci fi, with horror elements

**Additional components, beside what is already on SWN and Hostile**
- Faction based world, including MegaCorps and forefront conspiracy theories
- Possible mission oriented play: assigned jobs, bounties, etc.
- (tbd) Domain play (i.e.: player driven faction, once characters are higher level, and if players are interested in it)
- (tbd) Slaughter damage rules (i.e. some weapons have a chance of giving a massive damage - think of a shotgun)
- (tbd) Madness / sanity rules

NB.: Additional flavour from other games are always welcomed (OSR compatible preferred, but anything can be discussed)
