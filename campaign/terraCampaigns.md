# Campaigns timelines

## Silicon Samba
***Earth, early 22nd century***

The South-American empire leads population control technologies, inner solar system is sparsely colonised and Europeans lead early long-range space travel. Played in 2023, SWN/CWN hybrid.

## Benoordenhout Nova
***Tsatsos Alpha sector, early 32nd century***

Alien tombs are found in the Hard Light system. Played in 2023, SWN.

## Arrival
***Earth, millions of years in the future***

The Angels have come again to claim the Latter Earth as their dominion. They learned how to circumvent the Legacy protection so that their Suppraxae can operate as travelling ships and region protection machines. They will face the Sorcerer-King of Turnskull in the south, while the outsider god Ethux'zhur extends its dominion in the east. Played in 2023, 5e/WWN hybrid.

- Beyond wall of sleep, Lovecraft 
- Political intrigue?

My interests:
- Intrigue
- Not fantasy (except for sci fi + fantasy)
- Not wastelands
- Not cyberpunk
- Magic is ok if subtle
- if high power, should not be uplifting fantasy
