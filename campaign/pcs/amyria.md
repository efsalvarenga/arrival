- [ ] Born in the sanctity of a place of worship, she was raised by priests and clerics, devoting her life to the deity Mystra whom she worshipped with unshakable faith. With a unique ability to channel divine energy granted her many extraordinary powers and set her apart from her kin.
- [ ] Her passion for mysteries and the hidden secrets of her religion spurred her to maintain valuable artefacts, manuscripts and libraries. Amyria was also an accomplished writer, penning a book on her expertise in Lore, which was widely revered and found a home in libraries across the North.
- [ ] As Amyria's life progressed, she fell deeply in love with a half-elf and married him in a humble ceremony befitting her religious customs. He gifted her a ring-pearl and other fine jewellery that she cherished, and their love endured until his untimely death twenty years ago.
- [ ] She has heard stories of a powerful spirit imprisoned beneath the castle (over a century ago) and is eager to investigate further.
