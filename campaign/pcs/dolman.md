# Dolman Frostbraid

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nf8CCdf0TEB-3kLdnkjSumMrRrrmcTpkqncB5C9LUv8/edit

- [ ] I was abandoned at the doors of the Kiranu mines with days of age in a wooden box warmed with rabbit skin and a stone that no one could name together with letter that read:
> 		Dear fruit of a wandering adventure
> 		A beautiful story that could not be
> 		Your father Bari will nurture you to be an honourable man
- [ ] In the dwarven city of Kiranu everyone knows my story, and I grew up hearing I am not a true Kiranu dwarf.
- [ ] Our family specialise in combining alloys, making smithworks and jewellery.
- [ ] At the age of 35, I enlisted the Kiranu Host.
