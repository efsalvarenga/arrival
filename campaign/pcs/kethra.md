- [ ] At age 6, my parents & I were thrown out of her village because the villagers thought I was cursed. 
- [ ] My parents took refuge in the southeastern part of the Glasrath Mountains, scavenging for food where they could.
- [ ] My parents unknowingly disturbed the eggs & suddenly a Purple Dragon attacked them with a dark, hot fiery breath & killed them. The dragon then came to me & was also going to kill me but stopped, looked at me with curiosity & then left.
- [ ] Old sage who took me into her home & raised me - I spent my days living in nature, watching animals & hunting.
- [ ] But suddenly the dragon turned into the old sage & I realised that I had been raised by the dragon that had killed my parents.
