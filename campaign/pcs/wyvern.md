# Wyvern Miraak

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uWr5Y5yqpJrwX4s3inU-eT2oVXKURPqn_YaLdWLgKyE/edit

- [ ] At aged 15, I joined the Lance Defenders.
- [ ] I trained for 3 years to be a reconnaissance soldier before being prematurely (I wasnâ€™t fully trained) sent into battle in the Katho-D'Elsin War, where the dragonborns suffered heavy causalities. I was attacked by an Immolith demon & I was engulfed in flames.
- [ ] After being disgraced & thrown out of the Daardendrien Clan, I changed my name to Miraak.
- [ ] I long to be accepted back into my clan but the only way I can see to do this is to defeat a dragon & take its treasure horde back to the clan. I will not feel at home or content until I do this.
