# Secret and Clues

- [ ]  Thor’s hammer and bracers have been moved to another tomb. They used to be stored here in Thor’s chamber but someone moved them.
- [ ]  This area of the dwarven redoubt was never entered by the knights of Khors, so most of the tombs remain sealed.
- [x]  The strange twisting of the Wyrdweaver has been going on for hundreds of years but is getting worse exponentially. The longer the characters wait, the worse it could get.
- [x]  The twisting of the Weirdweaver and the leylines of the area have torn open rifts to other lands and other worlds. That’s how the dust goblins got here and that’s what opened the portals in the pools to the east.
- [x]  The trollkin fear the creatures in the tunnels to the east. Their own scouting parties never returned.
- [x]  Most of the scouting parties were killed and eaten by the Clacker Beetles. Some, however mutated into ‣  and wander still.
- [ ]  Thor’s hammer is part of a set that includes Thor’s gauntlets. Járngreipr.
- [ ]  Factions of Derro war with one another in the lower levels.
- [ ]  Some of the creatures tied to the third Icosahedron are as old as the citadel itself.
- [ ]  [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) travels among levels of the Scarlet Citadel serving [Gellert the Gruesome – Heir to the Scarlet Citadel](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Gellert%20the%20Gruesome%20%E2%80%93%20Heir%20to%20the%20Scarlet%20Citadel%20e9ddcae96bc34534819aa6e31472d690.md)’s needs and liaisoning with the inhabitants of these other levels.
- [ ]  [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) used the power of the third Icosahedron to summon all sorts of horrible entities from other worlds which now roam in the lower reaches. Each of these creatures must be destroyed to seal the third icosahedron.
- [ ]  There is a tributary of the Black River Styx traveling through the eastern part of the Clacking Caverns. It’s current is chaotic and unpredictable. One must travel the lower river to reach up to the upper tributary, not the other way. It’s a one-way tributary from the lower river to the upper river.
- [ ]  The third Icosahedron of the Wyrdweaver resides in a chamber on the 5th level of Scarlet Citadel off of the Black River. The creatures powering the third icosahedron are spread about levels 4 and 5.
- [ ]  The fourth icosahedron resides in the lowest depths of the Scarlet Citadel. [Gellert the Gruesome – Heir to the Scarlet Citadel](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Gellert%20the%20Gruesome%20%E2%80%93%20Heir%20to%20the%20Scarlet%20Citadel%20e9ddcae96bc34534819aa6e31472d690.md) himself draws energy from this most powerful and most destructive icosahedron of the Wyrdweaver.
- [ ]  The Wyrdweaver isn’t a god or a primordial or anything like that. It’s shape and form is not humanoid like the other gods of Midgard. The obelisk with its floating icosahedrons is as close to a physical representation of the Wyrdweaver as mortals are able to witness.
