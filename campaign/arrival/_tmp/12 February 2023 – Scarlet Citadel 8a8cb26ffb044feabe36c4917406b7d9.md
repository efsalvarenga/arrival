# Strong Start

The barriers are a-blaze. A whistle blows from behind them. And two owlbear roars echo through the chambers from behind. Trained dire owlbears are coming from behind.

# Scenes

- Owlbears are a’comin
- Faceoff with the Trollkin
- Moving into the Clacking Caves or moving to the Bat Caves.

# Secret and Clues

- [x]  There are many vaults to various gods and heroes build by the dwarves and containing valuable treasures and artifacts.
- [x]  Bjrynyar wants a helm kept in the tombs deeper in the Cackling Caverns that’s been calling out to him. Retrieve it and the trollkin will give the characters access through the Dwarven Barracks.
- [x]  Some of these tombs are in the Clacking Caves through the eastern tunnel.
- [ ]  There is a tributary of the Black River Styx traveling thorugh the eastern part of the Clacking Caverns.
- [ ]  The third Icosahedron of the Wyrdweaver resides in a chamber on the 5th level of Scarlet Citadel off of the Black River.
- [ ]  The fourth icosahedron resides in the lowest depths of the Scarlet Citadel. [Gellert the Gruesome – Heir to the Scarlet Citadel](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Gellert%20the%20Gruesome%20%E2%80%93%20Heir%20to%20the%20Scarlet%20Citadel%20e9ddcae96bc34534819aa6e31472d690.md) himself draws energy from this most powerful and most destructive icosahedron of the Wyrdweaver.
- [ ]  The Wyrdweaver isn’t a god or a primordial or anything like that. It’s shape and form is not humanoid like the other gods of Midgard. The obelisk with its floating icosahedrons is as close to a physical representation of the Wyrdweaver as mortals are able to witness.
- [x]  The Trollkin hate Imorta but fear her and what they’re doing down there. If they send anyone through, they could face repercussions. What guarantees could the character give to the Trollkin to let them pass.
- [ ]  [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) travels among levels of the Scarlet Citadel serving [Gellert the Gruesome – Heir to the Scarlet Citadel](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Gellert%20the%20Gruesome%20%E2%80%93%20Heir%20to%20the%20Scarlet%20Citadel%20e9ddcae96bc34534819aa6e31472d690.md)’s needs and liaisoning with the inhabitants of these other levels.
- [ ]  [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) used the power of the third Icosahedron to summon all sorts of horrible entities from other worlds which now roam in the lower reaches. Each of these creatures must be destroyed to seal the third icosahedron.
- [x]  Some of the creatures tied to the third Icosahedron are as old as the citadel itself.
- [x]  The Trollkin are conscripted by [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) to keep intruders from making their way down deeper into the Scarlet Citadel and interrupting her master’s delicate work.
- [x]  The trollkin enjoy raiding the surface and training their dire owlbears.
- [x]  The two other reavers are his lieutenants, Egail and Gostov. Bjrnyar is a veteran of many raids that taught him the value of patience and planning. Egail is a young
hothead who wants only to kill enemies and gain glory. Gostov looks up to Bjrnyar and respects his wisdom but also grows impatient with prolonged inactivity.
- [ ]  Factions of Derro war with one another in the lower levels.
