# Secret and Clues

- [x]  Garble recognizes that the chambers with the water portals would make a wonderful home for a nest of mushroomfolk, though it isn’t entirely safe until the twisting of the Wyrdweaver is taken care of.
- [x]  [Zula - Witch of White Forest](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Zula%20-%20Witch%20of%20White%20Forest%20196382953dca40b2b80ece94cada08ba.md)  has been feeding information to [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) about the characters.
- [x]  Few know who [Gellert the Gruesome – Heir to the Scarlet Citadel](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Gellert%20the%20Gruesome%20%E2%80%93%20Heir%20to%20the%20Scarlet%20Citadel%20e9ddcae96bc34534819aa6e31472d690.md) is. His liaison to the outside world and other factions inside the Scarlet Citadel is [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md).
- [x]  It’s rumored that [Gellert the Gruesome – Heir to the Scarlet Citadel](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Gellert%20the%20Gruesome%20%E2%80%93%20Heir%20to%20the%20Scarlet%20Citadel%20e9ddcae96bc34534819aa6e31472d690.md) has come to Redtower before.
- [ ]  [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) is a summoner of demons. She has a summoning circle in the Scarlet Citadel that she uses that lets her summon more powerful beasts.
- [ ]  [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) has summoned a band of demonic assassins to hunt down and kill the characters. They’re getting too powerful. And traveling down too low.
- [x]  The twisting of the leylines has rerouted and corrupted the Black River flowing down here.
- [x]  The Black River has flown down here beneath the lands far longer than any of the construction built below. It was this initial ley-line / shadow river that began the Holzanger’s quest for power.
- [ ]  The draw of the Dustlands portal on level 2 is tied to an entity Imortra summoned that didn’t go well at all. Even she wishes she had never done it but is too scared to face it. It is known as the Chained Thing.
- [ ]  One of the creatures that must be slain to break the bonds on the third icosahedron is Llagfel, the undead remains of a former follower of Charun who went bad.
- [ ]  Two factions of Derro battle for supremacy in the bat caves. Neither side is strong enough to defeat the other.
- [ ]  [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) herself is one of the anchors of the third icosahedron.
- [ ]  [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) is using the power of the third icosahedron to make herself immune to attacks. She can only be defeated by shifting over to a world in which the icosahedron cannot protect her. Imortra knows this and has summoned devils to protect her in this other world.
