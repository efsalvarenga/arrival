# Secret and Clues

- [ ]  The crown that [Bjrnyar –  Loki-touched Lord of the Trollkins](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Bjrnyar%20%E2%80%93%20Loki-touched%20Lord%20of%20the%20Trollkins%20ecf5594de8b94899b2bd1b59b560e84b.md) wants is possessed with a sliver of Loki, the trickster god of the North.
- [ ]  [Bjrnyar –  Loki-touched Lord of the Trollkins](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Bjrnyar%20%E2%80%93%20Loki-touched%20Lord%20of%20the%20Trollkins%20ecf5594de8b94899b2bd1b59b560e84b.md) comes from Trollheim to the far north. Their blood traces back to the Jotun during the foundation of the world. The Scalerend Clan – drake hunters who particularly don’t like the followers of the dragonkind.
- [ ]  Tricky dwarves secretly serving Loki stole Thor’s Hammer and gauntlets and moved them to the tomb of the Loki priest.
- [ ]  Thor’s hammer is part of a set that includes Thor’s gauntlets. Járngreipr.
- [ ]  A clacker beetle stole Loki’s crown and is wearing it. It commands the other clacker beetles and can cast some spells. Doesn’t speak common and the sliver of Loki doesn’t care for the beetle very much.
- [ ]  Factions of Derro war with one another in the lower levels.
- [ ]  Some of the creatures tied to the third Icosahedron are as old as the citadel itself.
- [ ]  [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) travels among levels of the Scarlet Citadel serving [Gellert the Gruesome – Heir to the Scarlet Citadel](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Gellert%20the%20Gruesome%20%E2%80%93%20Heir%20to%20the%20Scarlet%20Citadel%20e9ddcae96bc34534819aa6e31472d690.md)’s needs and liaisoning with the inhabitants of these other levels.
- [ ]  [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) used the power of the third Icosahedron to summon all sorts of horrible entities from other worlds which now roam in the lower reaches. Each of these creatures must be destroyed to seal the third icosahedron.
- [ ]  There is a tributary of the Black River Styx traveling through the eastern part of the Clacking Caverns. It’s current is chaotic and unpredictable. One must travel the lower river to reach up to the upper tributary, not the other way. It’s a one-way tributary from the lower river to the upper river.
- [ ]  The third Icosahedron of the Wyrdweaver resides in a chamber on the 5th level of Scarlet Citadel off of the Black River. The creatures powering the third icosahedron are spread about levels 4 and 5.
- [ ]  The fourth icosahedron resides in the lowest depths of the Scarlet Citadel. [Gellert the Gruesome – Heir to the Scarlet Citadel](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Gellert%20the%20Gruesome%20%E2%80%93%20Heir%20to%20the%20Scarlet%20Citadel%20e9ddcae96bc34534819aa6e31472d690.md) himself draws energy from this most powerful and most destructive icosahedron of the Wyrdweaver.
- [ ]  The Wyrdweaver isn’t a god or a primordial or anything like that. It’s shape and form is not humanoid like the other gods of Midgard. The obelisk with its floating icosahedrons is as close to a physical representation of the Wyrdweaver as mortals are able to witness.
- [ ]  Spider of Leng
