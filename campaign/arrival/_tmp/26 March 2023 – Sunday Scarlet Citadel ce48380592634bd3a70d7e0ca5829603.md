# Secret and Clues

- [ ]  Dorn can feel the tug of the river Styx the further down he goes into the dungeon. But it isn’t right. It’s not drawing spirits into the underworld as it should. The twisting of the ley lines due to the captivity of the Wyrdweaver has twisted the tributaries of the river Styx.
- [ ]  Garble can recognize that as long as the ley lines are being twisted in a knot, this isnt’ a suitable place to raise a mushroom civilization. But if they’re restored. This is an awesome place.
- [ ]  Those two portals to other wetlands make those two chambers particularly nice for mushroomfolk.
- [ ]  Mez can feel a force moving around in the lower levels that’s tearing open the rifts to the Dustlands and twisting the river styx in a knot. Until this is dealt with, Potter’s body cannot be laid to rest.
- [ ]  Malarky can feel the remaining icosahedrons and forces they’re placing on the leylines. And the rod helps.
- [ ]  The Wyrdweaver talks directly to Skrink. You’ve done well but the more I am freed, the more forces are placed on the remaining icosahedrons. Time grows thin.
- [ ]  The crown that [Bjrnyar – Lord of the Trollkins](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Bjrnyar%20%E2%80%93%20Loki-touched%20Lord%20of%20the%20Trollkins%20ecf5594de8b94899b2bd1b59b560e84b.md) wants is possessed with a sliver of Loki, the trickster god of the North.
- [ ]  [Bjrnyar – Lord of the Trollkins](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Bjrnyar%20%E2%80%93%20Loki-touched%20Lord%20of%20the%20Trollkins%20ecf5594de8b94899b2bd1b59b560e84b.md) comes from Trollheim to the far north. Their blood traces back to the Jotun during the foundation of the world. The Scalerend Clan – drake hunters who particularly don’t like the followers of the dragonkind.
- [ ]  Thor’s hammer is part of a set that includes Thor’s gauntlets. Járngreipr.
- [ ]  Factions of Derro war with one another in the lower levels.
- [ ]  [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) travels among levels of the Scarlet Citadel serving [Gellert the Gruesome – Heir to the Scarlet Citadel](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Gellert%20the%20Gruesome%20%E2%80%93%20Heir%20to%20the%20Scarlet%20Citadel%20e9ddcae96bc34534819aa6e31472d690.md)’s needs and liaising with the inhabitants of these other levels.
- [ ]  [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) used the power of the third Icosahedron to summon all sorts of horrible entities from other worlds which now roam in the lower reaches. Each of these creatures must be destroyed to seal the third icosahedron.
- [ ]  There is a tributary of the Black River Styx traveling through the eastern part of the Clacking Caverns. It’s current is chaotic and unpredictable. One must travel the lower river to reach up to the upper tributary, not the other way. It’s a one-way tributary from the lower river to the upper river.
- [ ]  The third Icosahedron of the Wyrdweaver resides in a chamber on the 5th level of Scarlet Citadel off of the Black River. The creatures powering the third icosahedron are spread about levels 4 and 5. These must be destroyed to release the third icosahedron.
- [ ]  The fourth icosahedron resides in the lowest depths of the Scarlet Citadel. [Gellert the Gruesome – Heir to the Scarlet Citadel](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Gellert%20the%20Gruesome%20%E2%80%93%20Heir%20to%20the%20Scarlet%20Citadel%20e9ddcae96bc34534819aa6e31472d690.md) himself draws energy from this most powerful and most destructive icosahedron of the Wyrdweaver.
- [ ]  The Wyrdweaver isn’t a god or a primordial or anything like that. It’s shape and form is not humanoid like the other gods of Midgard. The obelisk with its floating icosahedrons is as close to a physical representation of the Wyrdweaver as mortals are able to witness.
