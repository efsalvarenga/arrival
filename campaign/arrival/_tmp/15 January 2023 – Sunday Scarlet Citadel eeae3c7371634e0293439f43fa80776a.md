# Secret and Clues

- [ ]  The Dwarven Barracks were built by the dwarves back during the construction of the Scarlet Citadel.
- [ ]  Dwarves resided here instead of in Redtower to help deal with the friction between the dwarves and the people of Redtower.
- [ ]  Just to the north is an exit from the Citadel to a monument above.
- [ ]  An agent of [Gellert the Gruesome – Heir to the Scarlet Citadel](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Gellert%20the%20Gruesome%20%E2%80%93%20Heir%20to%20the%20Scarlet%20Citadel%20e9ddcae96bc34534819aa6e31472d690.md) named [Imortra the Debased – Disciple of Gellart](../Scarlet%20Citadel%20Database%206f1cc6531b5c4188a2e5f54716002c2a/Imortra%20the%20Debased%20%E2%80%93%20Disciple%20of%20Gellart%200ca3a3bfcc6a4585b92d529b81cf1bf5.md) comes to this level sometimes. The trollkin leave her alone because she’s dangerous and her master is even moreso.
- [ ]  There are caverns to the south east that the trollkin avoid.
- [ ]  This level includes a bunch of tombs left alone by the Trollkin. They’re scary.
- [ ]  The Gauntlet is to the right. It’s where they lure bad people.
- [ ]  The trollkin have a stable of trained dire owlbears. One of them got lost a few months ago but the trollkin never found it.
- [ ]  The trollkin chief is a reaver named Bjrnyar. The two other reavers are his lieutenants, Egail and Gostov. Bjrnyar is a veteran of many raids that taught him the value of patience and planning. Egail is a young hothead who wants only to kill enemies and gain glory. Gostov looks up to Bjrnyar and respects his wisdom but also grows impatient with prolonged inactivity
- [ ]  The two shamans are Giydya and Sassigne. Giydya is utterly loyal to Bjrnyar. She would (and has) killed other trollkin to enforce the chieftain’s decrees. Sassigne is a fanatical follower of Thor, but this zealotry is mostly a front to cover up Sassigne’s true devotion to Chernobog, whose rites were banned by Bjrnyar.
