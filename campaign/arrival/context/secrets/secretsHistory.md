# Secrets for History

## The Kyri

After the Kyri were awoken they started shaping the Ophaire as they saw fit, and created their own races while corrupting surface races and bringing them to the depths of the world. The war lasted more than 10 thousand years and covered Guemenos with death, fire and suffering. Ulkrunnar's son Gronz created a staff that had the power to obliterate large armies using a light power known as Uli.

Gronz used his staff for hundreds of years and was able to eliminate all the large armies from the Edrahil. The staff was not enough for killing the gods, but it was enough to weaken them. They were later imprisoned by Ulkrunnar in his Forsaken Hall, under the fortress of Turnskull (located in the ice sheets in the south pole). For the non divine inhabitants, although it was thought they were killed, they were rather sent to a world they called Acrisius. The use of the staff was called The Great Purge, but this history is unknown to most current inhabitants.

### The great purge

Part 1 (Draconic)

In eons past, the Kyri did awaken,
And molded Ophaire to their heart's desire,
They wrought their races and from the surface taken,
Those they corrupted with their twisted fire.

For centuries, the creatures of the dark,
The dragons, fiends, and ooze, they did thrive,
In Guemenos, the world's blackened mark,
Where Kyri and their kin waged war to survive.

Ten thousand years of darkness did ensue,
The land awash with death and endless pain,
Edraihil's domains were torn in two,
As Kyri armies marched, with war their reign.

Then Gronz, Ulkrunnar's son, did create,
A staff of light that could destroy the foe,
For hundreds of years, he did oblate,
Nek's followers theurgic fatal blow.

Part 2 (Celestial)

But Nek and his gods, they did survive,
Though weakened by the Great Purge's fire,
In Forsaken Hall, they did abide,
Deep below the fortress of Turnskull's spire.

For immortals, though, a fate worse than death,
To Acrisius, they were cast away,
A world unknown, where they drew their breath,
Forevermore, in darkness they would stay.

And so the world continued on,
In darkness, death, and endless pain,
The Great Purge's memory long gone,
As life in darkness did remain.

### Puppet masters

With Guemenos cleared out of the Edraihil, the Kyri started to shape the world to their liking. Many of the Kyri were amused by their power to silently corrupt peaceful civilisations and drive them to evil doings. This corruption became a game the evil gods played with the living creatures for thousands of years.

Ulkrunnar's daughter Merdijad devised a plan to conquer the remaining races or Guemenos by religion (even religions that follow Nek's imprisoned deities), culture and a network of multi-tiered treaties between different kingdoms and races. This plan is known as The Silk. Most of the large civilisations are not aware of the indirect control by Turnskull, under Merdijad rule. During these millennia Merdijad has also installed her commander, Lorqiroth, in the D'elsinese Empire.

## Absent Angels

Nek's children gods were imprisoned by Gronz, and it was for minor deities such as Mystra, Bonnalurie, Falet and Kimbarak to envision a plan to regain Guemenos.

In Acrisius, the Angels (now known as Acrisae) started from scratch, to build again all their technology and magic, while developing a strong and unbeatable army.

### The Reclaim Campaign

Around the year 11500 AT, known in Guemenos as 3499 of the new calendar (NC), the Acrisae started executing their plan to reclaim Guemenos. Their first scouts came from Acrisius leveraging the same Uli power, reverse-engineering from the information Bonnalurie collected when she faced the same power from the staff. Bonnalurie built 10 rings that enabled the scouts to travel to Guemenos. They've scouted Guemenos until 3855 NC when they travelled back to Acrisius to further advance the plan. By then, Bonnalurie had developed the portal opening machines that look like golden mechanical dragons, the Sulpraxae. 

The first stage of the campaign is to arrive in the barren plains of the Tolfoddund county, south of the Naragzah mountains, in the Khathan Empire and set up a large scale military camp. 

The location will be chosen so that access to Ammuinoth is possible, and the construction can be used to disguise Acrisae operations such as mining, construction and training. To make sure the region is empty of curious eyes, the Acrisae, with support from the Sulpraxae, will cause fear to the region inhabitants by scorching the earth and forcing them to neighbouring regions, including the mountains and its caves and mines.

It would cause suffering to the inhabitants of the region, but a large enough proportion can save themselves and create a new life for them. After the final conflict with the Kyri is finished, the world would be free of Ulkrunnar and his children. To the Acrisae that seems like an acceptable trade off.

In the year 3877 NC dozens of Sulpraxae and thousands of soldiers from the Acrisae army arrived in Guemenos. These soldiers will spend most of the first 5 years making sure the tribes of the region are driven off, and setting up the first encampment - which would then be developed into a large city state fortress - which would take 20 years more (and would be finished ~3902 NC). The plan is then for the city state would then be connected to the northwesterly civilisations with roads (100 km per year), economic and military treaties. 

Sulpraxae can use the Uli power to scorch the land, raising temperatures to above 60C temporarily, and keeping them around 50C for years, if necessary. The intent is to stop scorching after the first 5 years, but maintain pressure on people to not come close to the chosen place of the city-state, with targeted attacks when necessary.
