# Twilight Halls Asylum
***Commanding height: Motherlode & Isolated academy***

Some precious ore, rare wood, magical elixir, arcanely-potent extract, or other natural product is in great supply here. Anyone capable of extracting it without interruption would become very wealthy, though the natives, the local fauna, or rival competitors may make that ambition difficult to fulfill. The motherlode might be known only to the natives, or is perhaps known to no one at all due to its concealment or exotic nature.

5. E  Prospector devoid of moral qualms, Existing site owner who’s lethally paranoid, Local lord who intends to utterly exploit the eventual site owner
    
6. F  Humble laborer in the mines, Poor but talented prospector, Land-wise local who knows of it
    

C The substance is very hazardous to the extractor, Extracting it would break a very powerful local monopoly, It was buried or sealed away for a very good reason

T Sample proving the motherlode’s worth, Ancient tools that make extraction practical, Capital needed to begin extraction

P The dangerous extraction site itself, Cave where prior extractors stored their equipment, Makeshift barracks where the laborers sleep



A school of sorcerers, esoteric artists, hermit-scholars, or other educators is in the area. The place might once have been the heart of the ancient city where the academy was founded, or it may have special magical or aesthetic traits to attract practitioners, or the topic they study might be abhorrent to civilization. The academy is likely largely self-sufficient but its students and teachers doubtless retain some ties to the outer world.

5. E  Sinister headmaster, Powerful instructor with a dark purpose, Monstrous thing the academy serves
    
6. F  Sympathetic young student, Pilgrim aspiring to be admitted, Harried instructor needing help
    

C It has two curricula with the second being much darker and known only to initiates, It’s protected by its terrible patron power, An awful sacrifice is demanded of some or all students

T Tome of secret lore they’ve developed, Magical object they’ve created, Key to bypassing the academy’s defenses

P Mundanely-impossible lecture hall, Artistic work of inhuman nature, Site scorched and blasted by their mistakes or training errors
