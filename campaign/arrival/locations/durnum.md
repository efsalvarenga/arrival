# Dwarf Enclave of Durnum
***Dwarf enclave: Fallen prosperity & Broken spirits***

Ancient construction access and shaft to the Ammuinoth, which is **not connected to the tunnel directly, but through caverns in the Ghost Domain**. Small community (50 dwarves originally, reduced to 15) currently live in the area. They used to produce **simple metals, that were traded with the dust elves**. The **undead hordes** have raided them in the last months and they are in a state of **despair and dull apathy**. ***They feel Kimbarak has left them***.

- **Enemies** Dust elves caravans are squeezing the last produce they can get (due to quotas), and community is under pressure to produce.
- **Friends** Young leader wants to the community to move to deeper regions, with less mineral resources, but more protected.
- **Challenges** No alternative can get them to their original wealth position, unless the undead stop coming
- **Things** Whoever represents Kimbarak can help them regain self worth.
- **Perils** Crumbling mines
