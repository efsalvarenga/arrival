# Castle of Holzander

Around 3627 NC, the young Gerhardt Holzander discovered a rich Brezal Path tributary in the region, connecting to the Romburghia Road to the east and to the Darklake rivers to the west. This Brezal Path itself seemed to pool and gather strength deeper into the earth, which took the researcher to the Citadel built in the Ammuinoth tunnel. The isolation of the area was a good place for experiments that often involved chanting, arcane lights, and the strange smells of alchemical enhancements and distillations. It is told he bound himself to the ley line, giving himself and his children greater strength in using its magic. Over generations, the family interests delved deep into newts and amphibians, and then they became obsessed with horology, celestial mechanics, flotation and levitation, night creatures, angelic languages, and on and on, always seeking knowledge purely to possess it.

Location: [The Ammuinoth](../context/realms.md#Ammuinoth)

Probably 100 years later, duegar from the Ammuinoth took a keen interest in House Holzanger. These duegar agreed with Gerhardt III to protect the Citadel and, suddenly, there was a company of one hundred duegar and a half-dozen ring mages in the region. The duegar chased down and tamed owlbears from the steppes as hunting animals and guardians, and brought them to the Ammuinoth. With an even tighter collaboration between the Holzanger and the Duegar, the Citadel was expanded into a large castle and a vast subterranean dungeon. However, 40 years later, it is told the Faithful Faletist Knights of the Arch burnt the castle down under the Faletist Law of Magic, which prohibited earth magic investigation in the empire. The reality is that the castle was burnt and cleared by the Acrisae scouts, which were known in the region as the gold paladins. The FFKA claimed the action as none had claimed it, and it seemed like good propaganda for the growth of the church. Gerhardt IV was killed and his children disappeared.

Over the next 100 years, foul creatures have arrived and departed from the ruins and dungeons of the Burnt Castle of Holzander. These included cultists of Cuncharn (a minor deity under Algath), drows, demons and bandits alike. Void magic was developed within the walls of the castle and its dungeons, and often fractures to the obscure Ophaire were open. It is told a missing child of Gerhardt IV, Gerhardt the Changeling, came back to the castle with his son, Gellert the Gruesome, in company of the powerful arcane researchers Cagoth-ze and Imortra the Debased.

## Histories

### Version from research in Khazadzig

> You did find specific reference to the Burnt Castle of Holzander: The Holzander family took residence in it in 3627 NC and, 100 years later, made an alliance with the duegar. The duegar further expanded what was before a citadel in a massive castle, with expanded dungeons below. The duegar also brought in and bred ownbears in the tunnels.However, 40 years after that, the Faithful Faletist Knights of the Arch burnt the castle down under the Faletist Law of Magic, which prohibited earth magic investigation in the empire. The castle changed hands for many years and, more recently, is is lair of a psychotic, sadistic torturer and serial killer known  as the Gaoler, who seems to work under the command of the last Holzander: Gerhardt the Changeling.
> 
> More recent prophecies speak of a powerful spirit imprisoned in the dungeon and a large fracture to the depths of the earth.

The structure stands atop a low hill that slopes off gradually all around. The slope is gentle but the ground is rugged, broken by mushrooms and revines that you have never seen before. The fort was breached at the northwest and southeast corners, but the rest of the walls and the main keep still stand. The outer walls are 15 feet high. The main tower rises 40 feet, and the secondary keep is 30 feet tall but heavily damaged. Despite the damage and decay, itâ€™s still an impressive place that seems to have been built by skilled builders.
