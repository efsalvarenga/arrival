## Holzander Castle

- [ ] #strategic One who possesses Cagoth-ze’s ring and the instructions for recalibrating the time construct can set it randomly so it will almost never return back here again.
- [ ] #strategic The furnace in area 206 (pg 54) is drawing tremendous arcane power beyond any one wizard’s ability to control. The source of this power lies deeper in the castle. The draw of power to this furnace is keeping this power tethered and strained. It’s like a knot in a tangle of ropes.
- [ ] #spoiler Closing the portal requires more than just traditional magic or arcane manipulation. A darkness deep below the Scarlet Citadel is responsible for the open wound leading to the Dry Lands.
- [ ] #puzzle The multiple Theotechnical engines are pulling the brezal paths as strings and rifting reality. Each must be disabled to release the tension of the lines.
- [ ] #spoiler Level 4 are the unconstructed caverns of the Ghost Domain, now territory of a bat cult - where a dark river flows.
- [ ] The works in the Holzander castle is making the desert even more bare

- [ ] FFKA has incarcerated Otaehryn Valdove (chieftan of Rurkinar) in Linhe, the cult believers have now disbanded in the desert.
- [ ] FFKA believes the responsible for the undead in Linhe is Glasrath, and will lauch a campaign to destroy the mountain society.

## General

- [ ] #context Olivepia is where the head of the Faletist church sits. It is a religious empire with a strong hand on neighbour empires (other empires are vassals)
- [ ] #strategic **Glasrath: number of undead greatly surpasses the number of alive people (2-to-1), mostly working the mines. Singlestrike joins support for Ghuse and population is mostly in full support (about 200 soldiers and guards are supporting). If characters haven't noticed yet, they notice now, that people are looking more pale and seem a bit brain drained.**
