## Holzander Castle

- [ ] The furnace in area 206 (pg 54) is drawing tremendous arcane power beyond any one wizard’s ability to control. The source of this power lies deeper in the castle. The draw of power to this furnace is keeping this power tethered and strained. It’s like a knot in a tangle of ropes.
- [ ] Closing the portal requires more than just traditional magic or arcane manipulation. A darkness deep below the Scarlet Citadel is responsible for the open wound leading to the Dry Lands.
- [ ] The works in the Holzander castle is making the desert even more bare
- [ ] An agent of Gellert named Imortra comes to level 3 sometimes. The deepfolk leave her alone because she’s dangerous and her master is even more so.
- [ ] There are caverns to the south east that the Deepfolk avoid.
- [ ] The 3rd level includes a bunch of tombs left alone by the Deepfolk . They’re scary.
- [ ] The Deepfolk chief is a reaver named Bjrnyar. The two other reavers are his lieutenants, Egail and Gostov. Bjrnyar is a veteran of many raids that taught him the value of patience and planning. Egail is a young hothead who wants only to kill enemies and gain glory. Gostov looks up to Bjrnyar and respects his wisdom but also grows impatient with prolonged inactivity
- [ ] The two shamans are Giydya and Sassigne. Giydya is utterly loyal to Bjrnyar. She would (and has) killed other Deepfolk  to enforce the chieftain’s decrees. Sassigne is a fanatical follower of Thor, but this zealotry is mostly a front to cover up Sassigne’s true devotion to Chernobog, whose rites were banned by Bjrnyar.
- [ ] Arcanists in the black castle were pulling energy out of the twisted brezal paths for years which has put tremendous stress on the whole region.
- [ ] As each anchor of the black castle is removed or broken, the brezal paths twist in new directions.
- [ ] Only in removing all anchors can the brezal paths repair themselves and settle into their original position, and putting the land to rest.
- [ ] The alchemist’s forge was one such anchor.
- [ ] Undead / uncreated have begun to take over the first level of the scarlet citadel
- [ ] Weird mutated oozes have begun to take over the second level
- [ ] Gellert is trying to draw so much power that he’s almost certainly going to rip the Crossroads apart if left unchecked.
- [ ] Imortra travels among levels of the Scarlet Citadel serving Gellert’s needs and liaisoning with the inhabitants of these other levels.
- [ ] Factions of Derro war with one another in the lower levels.
- [ ] Many vaults and tombs exist in the lower levels of the Scarlet Citadel filled with untouched artifacts and treasures.
- [ ] There are many vaults to various gods and heroes build by the dwarves and containing valuable treasures and artifacts.
- [ ] Bjrynyar wants a helm kept in the tombs deeper in the Cackling Caverns that’s been calling out to him. Retrieve it and the Deepfolk will give the characters access through the Dwarven Barracks.
- [ ] Some of these tombs are in the Clacking Caves through the eastern tunnel.
- [ ] There is a tributary of the Black River Styx traveling thorugh the eastern part of the Clacking Caverns.
- [ ] The Deepfolk  hate Imorta but fear her and what they’re doing down there. If they send anyone through, they could face repercussions. What guarantees could the character give to the Deepfolk to let them pass.
- [ ] Imortra used the power of the brezal paths to summon all sorts of horrible entities from the void, which now roam in the lower reaches.

## Linhe

- [ ] FFKA has incarcerated Otaehryn Valdove (chieftan of Rurkinar) in Linhe, the cult believers have now disbanded in the desert.
- [ ] FFKA believes the responsible for the undead in Linhe is Glasrath, and will lauch a campaign to destroy the mountain society.
- [ ] Fractures start to appear - more undead and uncreated creatures crawling...
- [ ] Hermit's Crevasse is a ruined deep construction, now inhabited by Rurkinar Hermits. They are good people.
- [ ] The camp close to the canyon is protecting people against the stronger undead attacks of recent days. How?

## General

- [ ] **Glasrath: number of undead greatly surpasses the number of alive people (2-to-1), mostly working the mines. Singlestrike joins support for Ghuse and population is mostly in full support (about 200 soldiers and guards are supporting). If characters haven't noticed yet, they notice now, that people are looking more pale and seem a bit brain drained.**
