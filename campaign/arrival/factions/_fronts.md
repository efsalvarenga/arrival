# Large Fronts

## Rules

Roll a d20 every time party level reaches a new integer (from 5 onwards), against DC 10. On a success one front advances. Randomly assign which front advances, but the 7th front is always the last - and it should happen at level 20 latest.

## Milestones
***Current fronts: 2/8***

8 more fronts in total
- One kicking off the campaign - the arrival
- 3 each (Acrisae and Turnskull)
- Last: deflagration of full war. 

- [x] First front was the arrival.

**Acrisae fronts**
- [ ] Supraxae are now flying everywhere to maintain reconnaissance 
- [ ] Acrisae establish lines to the west with other civilisations to prepare for the war (Avryindt is in the way) - start Acrisae faction
- [ ] Acrisae brings military positioning to the surface and redies for war

**Turnskull fronts**
- [x] Part 3 starts: Khato's armies lose in the south, Kiranu and others will need to migrate north - start Turnskull faction game for measuring it's expansion 
- [ ] Part 4 starts: Big freeze from the south, with mists, start Turnskull faction
- [ ] Part 5 starts: Turnskull takes the entirety of south Etor, ready for war

- [ ] Deflagration of war
