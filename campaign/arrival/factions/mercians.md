# Mercians

- **Tier**: 3 - action die 1d10
- **Features**: 5 (organised)
	- Manipulating the Brezal Paths, Mercians can open rifts with the Ophaire in selected places - enabling indirect attacks
	- Lady scurvy accosting the lands
	- Mercian Battlemages (Maqqatba Knigths)
	- Cunning behaviour
	- Ethux'zhurh is connected to the Brezal paths
- **Trouble**: 4 (well-run)
	- FFKA influence taking over the Mercian religion (1 pt)
	- They might be messing up with powers beyond their control (2 pt)
	- Everyone has reservations with the Mercians (1 pt)
- **Goals**
	- [x] Feature: energy overflow and sky umbilicals to Hincland and Turnskull (cost 16: region, impossible) - eldritch blast style: break the Legacy seal and start Uncreation (research of the 'tho). When successful all hex ranks increase in 1, until the brezal paths are solved (finished Holzander) godbrain is full of energy and stops dying
	- [ ] Island the FFKA East, pincer move with Gellert in the south, lady scurvy in the north and the rest of the Mercians from the east.
	- [ ] Feature: energy overflow and umbilicals in the Ammuinoth, seising the tunnels from Hincland to Turnskull and creating a portal between the two regions (cost 32: kingdom, impossible)
	- [ ] Start the next doom cycle by reconnecting Mondedonvil and his body (dead made god)

## Court

- **Type**: Criminal
- **Power structure**: Autocratic. One person has largely unchallenged control over the court.
- **Temperament**: Blackmailing and spying for their leadership
- **Major actors**
	- [Gellert](../npcs/gellert.md): powerful magic, and the executor of the plan
	- Bekhud Jastul, Ghost rider commander: military arm with undead forces at disposal, provides muscle to the organisation
	- Ogam Muz, Hincland gang leader: knows secrets paths through the Ammuinoth, Ghost Domain, and surface to get anywhere
- **Minor actors**
	- Roving pickpocket
	- [Imotra](../npcs/imortra.md), debtor to Ogam, disciple of Gellert
	- Canny smugler for Ogam
- **Conflicts**
	- Disputes over weather to kill [Sergarus (FFKA East)](../npcs/sergarus.md): Gellert does not trust Sergarus, but Bekhud, who used to be an FFKA, trusts him. Ogam also believes he is better kept under tight control, so has been blackmailing Sergarus.
- **Consequence of its destruction**: Finances of Hincland and Rombhurgia depend on the Mercians
- **Defences**:
	- Magical prowess of Gellert
	- Ghost rider cavalry


## Details

![Mercian](../context/cultures.md#Mercian)

Mercians are the natural followers of Wuvurax. Many do so by following the folk polytheistic Mercian religion, of which Mondendovil is the forefather. But the religion itself lost influence in the last decades, with the expansion of Faletism from the west. However, even with the loss of religious influence, the cultural influence still persists strongly.

The faction intention is to expand its influence towards the southeast, and build a contiguous Ulkrunnar realm with Turnskull. When needed, they would also influence the FFKA in the east through an alliance with Sergarus.

Outside their strongest influence areas, mercians meet in what they call Mercian houses, and are very secretive.
