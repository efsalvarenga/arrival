# Glasrath Alliance

- **Features**
	- Being led by a necromancer, it is easy to keep a high number of members
	- Serhan is a very loyal capitan 
- **Trouble**
	- Scarcity of resources due to remoteness
	- Population living outside of their normal environments
- **Interests**
	- N/A
- **Goals**
	- [x] Stablished faction that partially follows Algath and Ghuse: Serhan (and 50 guards) is aligned with Ghuse. 
	- [x] Remove problem: Strengthen its hold in the region through cultural submission of subjects (cost 4: village + minor resistance, implausible) - number of undead greatly surpasses the number of alive people (2-to-1), mostly working the mines. Singlestrike joins support for Ghuse and population is mostly in full support (about 200 soldiers and guards are supporting). If characters haven't noticed yet, they notice now, that people are looking more pale and seem a bit brain drained.
	- [ ] Known people from the first days of the alliance are raised, including the dragon, Fuko and Nilperto - raise all the dead in the mines, and kill civilians to make up an undead army (cost 8: village + minor resistance, impossible). Count of military supporting: 300 (BR 250). Count of undead: 10k (BR 1000). For an average CR 4 (strong soldier Kiranu/Thymar) it will take about 420 of them to face the undead.
	- [ ] Feature: Whursock joins support for Ghuse - the alliance is now Ghuse's, and he turns to his Aivrindyt form now. Military supporting: 350.
	- [ ] Feature: hatch eggs?

## Court

- **Type**: Community
- **Power structure**: Consensus, but going to autocratic
- **Temperament**: Martial, expecting violence from the world
- **Major actors**
	- Ghuse ([Aivridyt](../npcs/aivridyt.md)), Army General and Cleric of Algath - the growing autocratic leader.
	- [Whursock Greybow](../npcs/whursock.md) , King regent, mostly not aligned with Ghuse
- **Minor actors**
	- [Serhan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E1a8Qd9eC7hKfJ8XC7YYTahPCcnoS9vmBUqRhX27rSI/edit#bookmark=id.ou4baxkvl1n1), NE male human guard captain, aligned with Ghuse. 
	- [Singlestrike](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E1a8Qd9eC7hKfJ8XC7YYTahPCcnoS9vmBUqRhX27rSI/edit#bookmark=id.jysa5ovdkfk5), LG dwarf mayor
- **Conflicts**
	- Ghuse has been using too much dark magic, Whursock does not agree but have limited power over Ghuse.
- **Consequence of its destruction**: The people currently living in Glasrath will suffer lack of trade and production
- **Defences**: Army of undead
