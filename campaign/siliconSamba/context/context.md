- **Depths Below**: A significant portion of the district exists below the elevated infrastructure, which was accessible again after the waters receded. The old MetroRio tunnels are also still there. The locals have repurposed old infrastructure tunnels, mineshafts, or subterranean buildings for their own purposes. Most such underways are under the control of gang bosses, local chieftains, and others indisposed to legal forms.
- **Media Factory**: Entertainment is produced in this district, with a host of VR producers, video creators, “journalists”, and other media types clustering in the area. Actors of every description hunt for their next role, and the local media corps grind them up monthly to make their necessary quota of corporate-approved media products. MI Group's offices are here.
