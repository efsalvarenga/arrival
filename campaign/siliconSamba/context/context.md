# Campaign themes

**Squalor**
> There’s no profit in maintenance. Everything in this world that isn’t an active corporate interest is run down, decaying, and stained. Infrastructure and urban monuments from a prior age may still work, but they do so with the minimum maintenance necessary. Slums and tenements are commonplace, and any place that looks genuinely nice has someone spending a lot of money to keep it that way. Emphasise the dirt, grime, and decay of the world, and the way in which the inhabitants no longer really register it as a problem.
> *Post apocalyptic theme.*

**Treachery**
> Everyone is out for their own interests, and they’re trustworthy only so long as their interests align with yours. Everyone assumes that deals will be kept only so long as they’re mutually profitable and relationships will only continue as long as they offer benefits to all parties. It’s not even a surprise when a partner backstabs you, because you were probably going to do it to him first if you found a way to profit from it. In your campaign, emphasise the fragility of business or criminal relationships, and how little loyalty exists in the face of a tempting profit.
> *Factions, factions and factions.*

**Urbanisation**
> Cyberpunk stories are almost always centred around cities. Rural areas aren’t just places with small towns, they’re often blasted wastelands occupied by rebels and refuseniks. Everything that’s important either happens in a city, or is about a city. To emphasise this theme, de-emphasize everything that exists beyond the city limits. Nothing out there matters, unless some urban event requires the PCs to enter that forsaken wilderness. Outside is dangerous because of the mutations.
> *The campaign will take place in the city and the surrounding Favela Wastes (the latter reinforces the post apocalyptic theme).*

# The world in 2102

## World problems

**Class Warfare**
> Numerous national revolutions cropped up around the globe. The details and ideologies varied, but they largely boiled down to revolts of the impoverished against the powerful. The powerful were utterly victorious, crushing all institutions and organisations they did not control and cementing their dominance over virtually all material means of survival and success. Bitter remnants still fight a losing battle.
> *Three main classes: **Blues** (Corps & Government), **Pinks** and **Greys**. There are also the **Un-Citizens**, living in the Favela Wastes or even beyond.*

**Resource Shortage**
> One or more critical resources, such as petroleum, rare earths, copper, or other material has run short either through over-exploitation or some new, disastrous natural reaction with modern atmospheric pollutants. Control of the remaining sources of this material is a common prize in megacorp struggles, and ordinary people have been forced to learn how to do without many things dependent on the substance.
> *Lack of cheap un-spiked food, lack of energy in general, high bills with low salaries.*

## History interview

**What was the main cause of the current global problems? Where were their seeds planted, and what event most characterised their inception?**
> Some say it were the wars, some say it were the plagues, but one thing is clear, the track the world went in the 20s and 30s, is responsible for where it has been since the 70s (refer to cwn198 for a timeline). The empowerment of the Mega Corporations, while true democratic states collapsed, opened the doors for a world in decline. Energy and agriculture technology coalesced in the hands of few, which sent waves of societal stratification and resource shortages year after year.

**How did the major powers react to the problems at first? What national response or megacorp reaction was most dramatic or famous?** 
> China, in an attempt to maintain its superpower status while recovering from the drastic population shrinkage, pulled off its power technology MegaCorp from the Market, allowing only the computing branch in foreign business. Europe and North America continued their fragmentation path due to their own regional wars, mere spectators of world problems and attempts at minimising them. Meanwhile, Brazil, with its authoritative government financing their Agricultural Corporation, seized the opportunity to apply control on the world, offering cheap "Spiked" protein sources, some believing the food has behaviour control properties. The Japanese Tsunami Corp used the opportunity to vertically integrate all sea security services, making sure consumer products and food can reach their destinations.

**How did society begin to respond to the problems? If the governments and megacorps had a high-level reaction to the start of the problems, what was the response of ordinary men and women? How did the general populace react at first?**
> In the late 70s, as the Market League landscape changed and governments fragmented, across the world societies felt insecure. Over time, the insecurity gave space to urban violence. The years of upheaval only ended when the "Spiked" protein sources were introduced globally. Over the decades society was coalesced into 4 strata: the Blues (MegaCorp and government aristocracy), the Pink (those in the grit neon cities who want the feeling of a free life - although many still work for Corps, direct or indirectly), the Grey (the poor, slaves of the system) and, finally, the Un-Citizens (those whose existence is illegal). These four "classes" hate each other and believe the other two or three castes are part of the reason their lives are so painful.

**Who obtained the most advantage from the problems? What nation or class profited most at first by what was happening, and what did they do with their gains?**
> Brazil, who secured access to the Pacific through integrating Mercosul with Colombia, made a profit from the scarcity of energy resources, feeding the world with spiked food. The Japanese (and their South Asia allies) made sure to vertically integrate and take over all sea security services for manufacturing logistics. The Chinese continue to make a profit on computing services. In the entire world, families that are part of high echelons of Davos League corporations continue to live in richness and in segregated environments, making sure to be isolated from the problems of the rest.

**What initial reaction failed most dramatically? What plan or response turned out to be most impressively wrong or unhelpful, and who suffered from it?**
> China's approach to pull out their energy technology, so that they would economically catch up, backfired with the returned adoption of local fossil and biofuel production across the world. The sulphur pollution and the smog are back to the cities now. In addition to that, the introduction of spiked food was not well accepted by many in society, with the belief that the food contains medications that make populations compliant. A thriving illegal market for unspiked food supports this belief, but also incite more societal violence.

**How did your country fail to deal with the problem? The problem obviously isn’t solved, so the country your starting city is located in clearly failed to deal with it. What was their plan, why did it fail, and what does its fallout look like?**
> Food scarcity at the world level is being addressed by Brazilian produce - which does not leave enough for the local population at an accessible price, who end up home growing their food illegally. Energy scarcity was supplanted by oil and gas reinvestment, which creates social unrest and a 22nd century offshore oil run. These two reasons drove South American governments to integrate in a Super Mercosur, led by Brazil and Colombia. The governments are authoritarian, corrupt and violent, specially with the lower strata of society.

**How did the problems become institutionalised? If the problem isn’t one that the authorities can solve, it becomes one they perpetuate and use for their own benefit. How are they directing the pain of these problems at their enemies or subordinates while reaping whatever limited benefits the situation provides?**
> Society divided in classes, with hate amongst them, makes it easy for the nations to identify what level of public service should be delivered to each "customer". Population dissatisfaction can be dealt with oppression, if needed. Food and energy scarcity are being "solved" by private institutions, with the expectation the market would regulate them eventually - while high taxes and royalties are paid to governments and corporations, respectively.

**Why can’t the situation last? Stasis is the enemy of easy adventure hooks, so you want your world to be moving in a bad direction. How are its problems starting to break loose from the institutional tools used to contain them, and what are the first signs that the situation is about to get dramatically worse?**
> - The Favela Wastes population are becoming desperate, pushing inwards into the city with enough violence that military forces will have to be called eventually.
> - The Grey have barely enough food to live and are not qualified to do any Corporation level jobs. Some decide to move outside the city, but some are decided to level society at their quality of life, introducing violence to their closest strata, the Pink.
> - The Pink are customers of lives they did not choose to buy, compressed between the violent Grey and the amoral Blue in their private castles.
> - The Blue need to maintain the unstable status quo for as long as possible, which maximises their gains in form of power, money or status. The stability is as thin as it has ever been.
> - Spiked food is being discredited by the population, while unspiked food is now illegal - forcing a traffic system to exist for food.
> - The fossil fuel requirements of Rio (main energy source) depend on a violent and brittle supply chain of offshore production, transport, refining and delivery. There are always enough groups interested in seizing operations or forcing extra royalties for the execution of the required services.

# Rio de Janeiro - Brazil

## City problems

**Border Lockdown**
> The region had some reason to tightly seal its borders, preventing people from entering or exiting without the right connections or governmental passes. It may have perceived some special threat from outsiders, or it was so miserable that its inhabitants had to be imprisoned to keep them from fleeing. The physical walls, minefields, and monitoring stations that kept the border tight probably still exist.
> *The city has 3 layers: Neo Rio (walled and patrolled city for the Blues), Cities within the walls (debris-bordered Rio & Niteroi and limit for Pinks and Greys) and Favela Wastes (Un-Citizens shanty cities).*

**Corrupt Leaders**
> The rulers of this region were even more corrupt than is usual for those in their position, trading the wealth and lives of their subjects for their own selfish purposes. They may have been so absorbed in exploiting the locals that the actual business of rule was taken over by outside parties, whether corporations, gangs, or local brotherhoods.
> *All government functions are privatised to commercial corporations, who pay high royalties to the City.*

## City map and features

- Smog, and horrible air conditions, in-house air requires expensive filter systems.
- Neo Rio is the privatised city, from where government and corporations are run from.
- City was challenged by the sea level rise, but the richer parts of the city (neon areas) were refurbished with elevated infrastructure. The level has now gone down again, and the areas below the elevated infrastructure are slums.
- The rest of the city within the borders are old districts in squalor.
- Outside of the borders live the Un-Citizens in what is called Favela Wastes. Some isolated mega industrial complexes are still run from these areas, but highly secured.
- Cyberware is relatively commonplace (i.e. it isn’t a surprise to see someone wearing it) but not that many people have it (in this case only Blues & a limited number of Pinks). To balance this, there is a vast range in quality in cyberware with some really poor quality that easily malfunctions. If you have access to vast amounts of money then you can basically get whatever you want.

# Districts

## Zona Sul (Neon District)

- **Depths Below**: A significant portion of the district exists below the elevated infrastructure, which was accessible again after the waters receded. The old MetroRio tunnels are also still there. The locals have repurposed old infrastructure tunnels, mineshafts, or subterranean buildings for their own purposes. Most such underways are under the control of gang bosses, local chieftains, and others indisposed to legal forms.
- **Media Factory**: Entertainment is produced in this district, with a host of VR producers, video creators, “journalists”, and other media types clustering in the area. Actors of every description hunt for their next role, and the local media corps grind them up monthly to make their necessary quota of corporate-approved media products. MI Group's offices are here.

### Active gangs

- **[Marimbondo](../factions/marimbondo.md)**: Known for their hirelings that work for any corp willing to pay their fees. They are heavy invested in cyberware and are led by [Tom Elliot](../npcs/tomElliott.md).
- **[Irmaos Corvo](../factions/irmaosCorvo.md)**: A known hacker group that does the dirty work of the government. They are led by [Clarissa Gomes Gomes](../npcs/clarissaGG.md).
- **[Macacos Amarelos](../factions/macacosAmarelos.md)**: A group of Japanese petty thieves. They are led by the fearsome and violent Shimoda Sakae.

### Active corps

- **MI Group** (subsidiary of Mídia Internacional) is headquartered in Ipanema. [Marisa Jardim Soares](../npcs/marisaJS.md) is a representative.
- **BlueGold** has a large clinic in Copacabana. [Ronaldo Baar](../npcs/ronaldoBaar.md) is a representative.
- **Tsu LatAm** (subsidiary of Tsunami SS) have a advanced post in Leblon. Captain [Hada Togai](../npcs/hadaTogai.md) is a representative.

## Neo Rio

- **Restricted Access**: People are not allowed to enter or leave the district freely. The locals might be sec- ond-class citizens, they might be too important to risk outside intruders, or they might be too troublesome to risk letting them wander. Only those with the necessary passes and justified business are allowed in or out.
- **Good Times**: Things are actually pretty good in this district. Whether by chance or design, the local economy is strong enough to give people hope of upward advancement and the local streets are unusually safe. These good times can easily provoke restiveness among the populace, however, as they move to strike violently against anything that threatens their prosperity.

## Barra

- **Canal District**: Where other districts have streets, this one has waterways. It may be the product of never-corrected flooding, a seacoast geography, or a city improvement plan gone awry, but the locals have gotten used to getting around in small boats. Aquatic cyber is relatively common here.
- **Vice Dens**: This district offers services too repugnant or degrading to be welcomed by its neighbours. Entire subcultures may have formed around facilitating sins that aren’t even physically possible without VR headsets or specific cyber implants. Other citizens might despise this district, but they do enough business to draw large amounts of money here.

## Alto

- **Crazed Gangers**: Most gangs are at least slightly bizarre in their rites and customs, but the gang powers here are absolutely insane. They take their particular obsessions to unprofitable extremes, being driven by a demented religion, lunatic ideology, or absurd dictation of fashion. Their leaders may be fully aware of the irrationality of their chosen life, but be too nihilistic or privately profiting by it to abandon their path.
- **Outsider Enclave**: A significant chunk of this district is under the administration or control of an outside power, whether a rival city, neighbouring nation, or outside corporation. It may be a remnant of a prior war, corporate takeover, city secessionists, or sheer governmental indifference. Laws inside the enclave may not match others in the city, and access in or out may hinge on diplomatic connections or useful smuggling ties.

## Maracana

- **Sweatshop Labour**: Factory work is rarely safe and decently-paid. Here, it’s nominally worse than slave labour, because slaves expect to be fed. Some massive factory or other economic enterprise is eating up poor labourers, wringing what work they can from them before leaving them broken and discarded. Most hold out hopes of decent pay and advancement, making good on it only often enough to keep the dream alive.
- **Transport Nexus**: A major port, airport, cargo hub, or transfer station serves as a major employer in the district, and influences from far-distant cities are common. Numerous not-entirely-licit immi- grants and strangers can be found here.

## Niteroi

- **Annexed District**: A significant part of the district used to be an independent city or town with its own officials and government. At some time in living memory, the city annexed it, with or without its consent, and the former rulers still seethe with resentment, perhaps retaining certain secrets about the place.
- **Impending Doom**: The district’s main industry (cyberware) is about to die - moving to Barra, threatening to throw the district into chaos. Everyone knows it’s going to happen soon, and everyone’s trying to make friends and settle the scores necessary to survive it.
