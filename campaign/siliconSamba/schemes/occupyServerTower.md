## Descriptions

 - **Milestone 1**: Execute a test run on a cash briefcase bomb
 - **Milestone 2**: Kill the substitute financial director, to gain time to rescue the one that went missing.
 - **Instrumental Goal**: The financial director of Renovabras was kidnaped and will be killed if ransom is not paid. Tsu LatAm cannot be involved in the transaction, so they need someone to deliver the money. The financial director is required to approve the funds that Tsu LatAm will require to execute the goal of the scheme.
 - **Milestone 3**: Work with the financial director to redirect cash from Renovabras' coffers to Tsu LatAm
 - **Milestone 4**: Market manipulation - Undermine gas infrastructure that feeds Down Angel's servers so that re-routed gas will cost more, and will keep them busy.
 - **Final Goal**: Occupy and take down the servers of Down Angel for 24h, as a response to the public statements the Down Angel Brasil directors have made with regards the corruption of the BOPE companies in Zona Sul.
