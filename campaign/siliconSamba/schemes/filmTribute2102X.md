## Descriptions

 - **Milestone 1**: Replace someone in their job - Plant a prefecture ex-secretary in the vice-president team, to convince the VP to be favourable to the tribute scheme.
 - **Milestone 2**: Forcibly seize an innovative new business - Take by force Studio 23, and make sure to maintain the CG video artists in contract to continue the development of the new Tsu LatAm media campaign.
 - **Milestone 3**: Get someone killed - Get the film maker guild president (who is against the tribute) killed, so the VP takes over.
 - **Goal**: Create a product - find a new district tribute scheme on film making to increase the prefecture budget.
