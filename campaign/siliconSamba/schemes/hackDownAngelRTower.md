## Descriptions

 - **Milestone 1**: Sabotage the CGI videos produced and advertised by Down Angel, so they pass the wrong message
 - **Milestone 2**: Force a group of Posto 12 Milicia to work for them, providing security in an assault to the research tower.
 - **Milestone 3**: Hack and destroy Down Angel's research tower for CGI films in Copacabana
 - **Goal**: Change their image - The hacking group is not well seeing in Zona Sul as people on the Neon City dislike nationalists and government supporters, they want to be seen as pro-Filmmakers
