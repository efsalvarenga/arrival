## Tag

Unleashed Beast

There’s a monster running amok during the mission, one probably just as dangerous to the targets as the PCs. This may be a literal beast in the form of a haywire cyber-animal or it may be some uncontrollably deranged ganger or psychotic cyber- killer. The PCs may be able to avoid it if they can manage to keep from drawing its attention.

E Prototype cyber-enhanced guard animal, Ultra- chromed killer off his meds, Corporate security chief sent to wreck things here by his superiors

F Survivor of an encounter with the beast, Relative of a recent victim, Past ally of the beast that regrets it

C The beast is actually doing the most damage to the mission target, There’s a limited window of time before the beast is released, Nobody knows the beast is there until it’s too late

T Some code or device that will kill the beast, Valuable stash left by victims of the beast, Precious trophies kept by the beast

P Horrific massacre site, Broken-open bunker that tried to hold out, Facility with everyone holed up in hiding

Reckless Gang

A gang is going far beyond the customary subjects of violence in the area, hitting targets that are supposed to stay untouched. City cops, corp security, ruling gang personnel, or other protected figures are taking heat, either because the gang is suicidally overconfident or because they have backers that can plausibly protect them from the consequences. They may or may not be correct in their assumption.

E Megalomaniacal gang boss, Corp manager planning to sacrifice the gang, Gang strategist who’s actually in the pay of a rival group

F Local victim of the new uproar, Gang deserter who dreads the consequences, Local elder trying to calm things down before it’s too late

C The gang actually does have an effective secret weapon, The gang profoundly misunderstands the political situation, Somebody’s been paid off to incite this situation

T Contraband the gang stole in a surprise raid, Payoff made for their services, A priceless object they stole from someone very important

P Aggressively obvious new gang stronghold, Bombed-out police station, Site of the massacre of a supposedly untouchable group of people
