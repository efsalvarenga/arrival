Unwelcome Refugee
A person or group involved in the mission is fleeing a bad situation and the other entities involved in the job are not happy with their presence. They’re either complicating the situation, an active threat to one of the parties involved, or whatever chased them out of their old lair is now pursuing them into their new location.

5. E  Murderous avenger pursuing the escapee, Monstrous brute fleeing consequences, Gang boss forced out of their old turf
    
6. F  Local displaced by the newcomer, Pursuing victim of theirs still seeking justice, Relative or associate of a sympathetic refugee
    

C The refugee remains tolerated precisely as long as they remain useful to someone, The refugee is biding their time until fellows or allies arrive in overwhelming force, The refugee is actually an infiltrator from a hostile group

T Valuables carried away by the refugee, Buried cache they left behind, The object they stole that forced them to flee in the first place

P Makeshift squat in the slums, Club for the refugees, New-built gang HQ or shop run by the refugees


Unexpected Heat

This mission is going to infuriate someone a lot more than might seem reasonable. Some part of the job touches a very tender spot for a corp, city government, or gang organization, and they will respond with seemingly outsized force. The sensitive spot might not even be the mission objective, but something somehow related to obtaining it.

5. E  Corp exec with a top-secret project, Gang boss making an important secret move, City gov black project director
    
6. F  Corp worker who’s noticed something strange, Victim of the secret activities going on, Last surviving operator of the last team to try this
    

C The heat is actually going to come from a third party’s activities, Avoiding the heat is possible but taking it is very profitable, The heat is going to turn former allies into provisional enemies

T Ultra-illegal contraband, Radioactive blackmail material, Critical corp data files that got here accidentally

P Ordinary-looking corp facility with heavy interior defenses, Hidden corp security dispatch, High-tech security facility hidden behind a front company
