### Nulfirth

Nomadic and/or rural in nature. Very few cities lie in the desert, but some small cities are found in the coastal areas. Most of the Nulfirth people are mixed breed between several species such as dust elves, dwarves, gnomes, halflings and humans.

Living conditions are very tough for the Nulfirth, and those who reach adult age are generally hardened by their survival. Magic is not widely accepted by the Nulfirth. Most are ok with it, but prefer it away from them (and don't like being involved with it). A few are very intolerant.

The common language spoken by the south Nulfirth people is called the Cold Nulfirther. Younger people (20 years old or less) would also speak the Khathan language. In the north of the Glasrath Mountains, Nulfirth people speak a dialect called Sun Nulfirther, and the official Khathan language.

### Kimbarak

The Kimbarak people are made of dwarves, living in the Glasrath Mountains in the [Naragzah Dwarven Empire](realms.md#Naragzah%20Dwarven%20Empire) or in [Kiranu](realms.md#Kiranu), in the eastern mountain range. They are more open to magic than the Nulfirth people. The Naragzah Empire and Kiranu both speak the High Kimbarak language.

***Kimbarak Mines***

The mine caves are very tall, with most main ways well above 10m tall. The tunnels are also very wide (sometimes kilometres), with full height for about 50-100m in width in the centre, while the borders are where excavation, extraction and processing takes place. The centre is dedicated to the main mine logistics, which rely on giant lizards that run a chain cycle, pulling massive mine carts round the mine. Half tunnels are built on the top part of abandoned extraction areas, and these are living accommodations and civil spaces. Multiple ditches are built on the tunnels, where sewage and animal waste is collected. Clean water still runs on a few heightened ditches.

Dwarves funnel and filter light (and air, naturally) down into their dwelling caverns via long diamante-lined shafts, the same design that the timeclock uses. Similar structures are used, closer to the surface, to light the large fields of vegetation.

Alternatively to light clockworks, the mineral Sunstone can be heated and would radiate light primarily in the portion of the spectrum needed by plants — which made for rather strange lighting, since plants primarily use blue and red light. It could also be let sit in the sunlight, after which it would radiate more of a full spectrum for five or six times as long as that exposure. Sunstone is thus used anywhere the dwarves want growing plants, usually carved into ovoids about the size of a typical soda can. An underground city had about three times the amount of sunstone actually needed for lighting, one portion in use, another portion in storage for replacing the ones that started getting dim, and the third portion being heated.

Sewage is the nutrient source. It isn't used directly, but is composted with vegetable table scraps plus sawdust and wood chips. The compost is mixed into existing soil and spread across especially level cavern floors or on terraces lining the sides of caverns. When a new section of farming area is opened up the dwarves have been known to actually import solid waste from humans, both human waste and animal manure, along with vast amounts of sawdust and wood chips from logging and lumber operations, to make huge amounts of compost. The first layer in a new field in a cavern is rubble, waste from rock carving in pieces walnut-size or smaller, then river sand and gravel topped with ordinary dirt, and finally their compost soil mix.

### Thymar

To the west of the Naragzah mountains lies the Thymar people, which are mostly Dragonborn. They are more open to magic than the Nulfirth people. Thymar dragonborn speak Draconic.

### Mercian

The Mercians are a non-religious, mostly human population with a rich oral tradition of storytelling and a love of music and dance. The Mercians date back to a religion group, but the religious aspects are mostly foregone now. Most of the population is now converted to other religions such as [Faletism](religions.md#Faletism) and [Yotunn Ancestors](religions.md#Yotunn).

Their oral tradition, which often tells tales of heroes, mythical creatures, and gods, is an essential part of their culture, and they often use music and dance to celebrate important events. They also use runes for divination and magic, consult with rune masters for guidance, and have a distinctive fashion style that symbolises their status and identity, wearing dark clothing, often adorned with jewellery and tattoos. The Mercians value personal freedom, have a deep connection to the land, and rely on each other for support and protection.

#### Antinom
***Source: aole124***

The Antinom is a living curse-weapon devised by some ancient sorcerer-king to bring down the civilisations of his rivals. They are effectively immortal, though they occasionally reproduce by infecting a human host with a curse that gradually transforms them into a new Antinom.

An Antinom appears to be a normal baseline human of whatever ethnicity predominates in a region. They are invariably rebels, renegades, or demagogues against some presiding power or generally-accepted moral code; they denounce it and work to topple it through allied disaffected humans. They subtly inflict their curses on such targets as would most destabilise whatever they are fighting, and will push the point until their rebel cell is destroyed or their target is discredited or brought low.

The Antinom does not stop at that point, however, because its entire purpose is to break, ruin, and discredit any organising principles. It continues to tear down and denounce all possible replacements for the fallen edifice, seeking to keep the local humans in a constant ferment of struggle. Even basic ties between family and loved ones are anathema to it, and it will work to isolate and atomize all the people around it as much as its greater plans allow.

An Antinom will continue its social destruction until it is killed or until it judges that success is impossible. If necessary, it will swiftly flee to a different land to target the institutions there.

### Anak
***Source: wwn306***

Sages believe that the original Anakim were a spite-weapon created by the Outsiders when the fall of their hegemony seemed imminent. Captured rebels, still-subject Deeps, and human traitors who were no longer needed were used as the feedstock for the transformation, one intended to create a sentient bioweapon for the destruction of all human and demihuman life in the Latter Earth.

Later ages saw the Anakim modified by assorted Imperators, their original nature warped and tuned to serve the purposes of the experimenters. The resulting Anakim sub-species are sometimes drastically different from the ur-Anak, but the intrinsic selfishness, cruelty, and aggression of the base stock persist in most of them.

#### Anak Physiology

Anakim are divided into several sub-species and variant body plans, some more prevalent than others. The ur-Anak, or “Great Anak” is humanoid in shape, with males averaging six and a half feet in height and two hundred pounds, females being slightly smaller. Skin and hair tones vary based on the original human feedstock, but vivid and unnatural colors are introduced in some groups. Facial features and other bodily details are usually de- signed to play on primal human terrors, with skull-like features, claws, fangs, bestial muzzles, disease lesions, and other qualities common in different sub-strains.

“Lesser Anakim” are a common smaller variant of the ur-Anak. Their origins are disputed among the sages, some believing them the result of an Imperator’s experimentations, while others crediting them as a natural evo- lution of the Great Anak. These creatures share many of the same features as their larger cousins, but are much smaller and spindlier in build.

“Ogres”, “titans”, “hulks”, or “brute Anakim” are an uncommon expression of Anak nature in which one grows to a height and mass far beyond its peers, often standing as much as nine feet tall. This growth tends to come at the cost of neural development, and most hulks have the mentality of a small, particularly vicious child. While hulks breed true, their stupidity and aggression tend to control their numbers in the wild.

All types of Anakim usually breed much more quickly than humans, with females bearing litters. This fecundity is necessary to maintain their numbers, as Anakim mature only slightly more quickly than humans. These three kinds of Anakim are merely the most common in the Latter Earth. Other varieties, including no-longer-humanoid strains are known in certain lands. Some even appear very similar to baseline humans, hav- ing a barbaric sort of handsomeness about them; most of these variants are just as vicious as their uglier brethren.

Even so, a few Anakim strains are less aggressive than their kindred, and some can even maintain a wary sort of mutual non-slaughter with human neighbors, provided a safe distance is maintained.

#### Anak Psychology

All Anakim are touched to a greater or lesser degree by the “Hate”. This ancient Blight infects them with an overwhelming revulsion and loathing toward baseline humanity and most demihuman species. Some scholars believe that the Hate is triggered by some pheromon- al marker or arcane soul-dissonance. Others believe it is keyed on physical appearance, and is simply an un- bearably amplified natural response toward physical ug- liness. Whatever the source, Anakim find humans and human-like demihumans to be unendurably loathsome.

This Hate is worsened by the naturally aggressive, vi- olent, and cruel instincts implanted in them by the Blight. Most Anakim behave in ways largely identical to human psychopaths, having no innate sense of empathy and no desire to obey any principles higher than their own plea- sure. They delight in torture, slaughter, and sordid excess, and other Anakim are perfectly acceptable targets.

The only effective shackle for an Anak’s instinct is sheer terror. With nothing more precious to them than their own lives, a leader or opponent who can display overwhelming force and a certain ability to slaughter them will provoke a response of groveling obedience and abject submission. This submission will tend to last precisely until the Anak no longer feels this awe.

Anakim society, such that it is, is held together by brute force and temporarily-shared ambition. A chieftain or warlord will arise, murder all nearby rivals, and force the local Anakim into obedience in order to plunder and slaughter all available targets. When that warlord shows weakness, he or she will be replaced by their most ruth- less underling. This churning chaos tends to limit the size of Anakim societies, with most existing on no more than a tribal basis in the absence of some overwhelming leader.

#### Anakim Encounters

Most Anakim will be encountered in groups, either as scouting parties, raiding bands, or the main encamp- ment of the tribe. Scouting parties will usually consist of 1d4+1 warriors, raiding bands might number 2d6+6, and main tribal camps might have as many as fifty or sixty combat-capable Anakim. Great warlords can weld together dozens of tribes into a single horde, as can other powerful entities capable of terrifying the Anakim.

Anakim are vicious and cruel, but they are not particularly stupid. Most tribes have the services of at least one competent sorcerer, usually the equivalent of a first or second-level Elementalist or Necromancer in their abilities, though of a very different tradition. Es- pecially powerful tribes might have access to stronger mages. Tribes that are in service to some dark god or malevolent arch-sorcerer are particularly known for their magical prowess, with an Anak high priest sometimes attaining powers equal to sixth or even seventh level as a Mage. Were it not for the relentless backstabbing with- in Anakim society, it’s possible that these devil-sorcerers might become as skilled as any human mage.

Despite the Hate, an encounter with Anakim does not inevitably devolve into immediate violence. An Anak loves nothing except his own life, and no warrior will fight unless victory seems assured or some present lead- er demands that they fight. Strong parties or those that offer some tempting inducement in place of bloodshed might be able to parley with Anakim, as some of them are known to speak Trade Cant in order to command slaves.

One particular trait of almost all Anakim tribes is the sacred terror. This psychological instinct was em- bedded in them in order to give them some limited mech- anism for direction.

When an Anak is faced with some overwhelming foe and fails a Morale check, they will either flee for their lives or immediately seek to placate and submit to the foe.

Their choice will depend on whatever outcome seems most likely to keep them alive. This terror will persist until their new leader proves weak or pushes the Anak into a situation where disobedience seems more surviv- able than compliance. Exceptional temptations might cause temporary disobedience to the leader, however, if the Anak thinks its defiance can be hidden.

#### Anakim and Others

Anakim get along poorly with each other, let alone other species. Given that a single Great Anak warrior is worth almost two ordinary human soldiers, it’s only this conten- tiousness and grasping treachery that has kept them from overwhelming many of their hated neighbors.

Few human nations have any formal relationship with the Anak raiders beyond their borders. Desperate kings may seek to bribe the tribes into a temporary peace, or make concessions until they’re able to muster their defenses, but only the most brutal and iron-fisted rulers can compel a lasting obedience from the Anak tribes.

Trade with the Anakim is almost invariably viewed with horror by those subject to their raids, but that doesn’t stop smugglers and grasping merchants from seeking to trade weapons and luxuries for Anak loot. Sometimes these dealers even live to spend their profits.
