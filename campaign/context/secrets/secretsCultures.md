## Mercian

Mercian people are mostly humans, very cunning, and prefer to act on the background. Their influence also expands towards the Ghost Domain, where they lead a cavalry of Ghost Riders. The military strength is mostly used to avoid investigations from other groups on their works in Hincland (surface and subsurface). Most of the Mercian power comes from magic investigation through runes. 

Mercians are 'tho thralls. Create a Mercian cult to the 'tho.
