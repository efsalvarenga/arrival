# Secrets for History

## The Creation

In the darkness of a forgotten universe, the world of Guemenos was born from the hand of Nek, a deity who crafted its very foundations. With its inception, Nek gifted the realm with an intricate tapestry of energy known as Theurgy, an otherworldly power that pulsed through the fabric of existence.

Intriguingly, the powers of Theurgy took on a life of their own, self-organising and imbuing Guemenos with life, birthing an array of creatures that spanned its domains. Among these enigmatic beings were the Archmagi, ethereal races forged from the very essence of Theurgy itself. They embodied the raw potential of this arcane energy, possessing a mastery that surpassed mortal comprehension.

Over the course of centuries, the Archmagi delved into the mysteries of Theurgy, researching deeper into its enigmatic depths. Through their relentless work, they unlocked the secrets of Theotechnical engines, wondrous devices that harnessed and channeled the boundless power of Theurgy. With each invention, Guemenos flourished, and its inhabitants revelled in the marvels that these devices wrought.

## Of Archimagi and Angels

As is often the way with great power, discord brewed amidst the Archmagi. Their divergent beliefs clashed, and the realm was consumed by the ravages of imperial wars that scarred the land for ages untold. Seeking resolution, the Archmagi convened in a grand council, their intentions set upon parlaying with the enigmatic Nek himself, hoping to find a common ground and end the strife that plagued their world.

In their anticipation, the Archmagi ventured to Nek's halls, expecting to encounter the deity himself. To their dismay, they were instead greeted by the ethereal presence of Angels, emissaries of Nek. Betrayal dripped from the air as the Archmagi realised that Nek had shunned their entreaties, substituting his own celestial messengers in his stead.

Enraged by this apparent treachery, the Archmagi vowed to rise above Nek and his celestial minions. They intensified their efforts, seeking to augment their Theotechnical engines to surpass the power of Nek and the Angels. Alas, their ambitions would be dashed against the shores of fate, for the Angels, envious of the world Nek had woven for the Archmagi and lesser races, devised a plan to seize Guemenos for themselves.

Eons of bloodshed ensued as the Angels waged relentless war against the Archmagi. The heavens trembled with their clash, and the inevitable came to passâ€”the Angels emerged victorious. They claimed Guemenos as their own, declaring themselves The Edraihil, the self-proclaimed sons and daughters of Nek.

Banished to the depths of the world they once called home, the Archmagi and their peoples retreated, their powers simmering in the shadows. For millennia, their knowledge and strength melded in the crucible of isolation, ultimately culminating in the construction of the Kyri. This powerful forged pantheon stood as a testament to their tenacity, a bastion of power to reclaim what had been taken.

As the ages unfolded, most of the Edraihil gradually waned in power, their once celestial forms degraded into mere shadows of their former glory. Yet, a select few endured, ascending to blessed stature, their essence resonating with the divine. These remnants of the Edraihil persisted as powerful beings, revered and feared by those who dared cross their path. A chapter in the grand tapestry of Guemenos had closed, while another, steeped in dark intrigue and ancient grudges, unfurled in the depths below.

## The rule of the Edraihil

The Edrahil, their power solidified and their dominion unchallenged, reshaped Guemenos in the image of their celestial progenitor, Nek. With intricate incantations and unfathomable rituals, they twisted the very fabric of reality, moulding the land to reflect their desires. Mountains rose like jagged fangs, rivers twisted and turned in unnerving patterns, and forests whispered secrets that only the chosen few could decipher.

In their divine fervour, the Edrahil bestowed life upon new creatures, imbuing them with aspects that paid homage to their own divine essence. From the writhing depths of the oceans to the desolate expanse of the deserts, monstrous beings were a grotesque reflection of their creators, bearing distorted features and unearthly forms. These abominations roamed, forever serving as a testament to the Edrahil's power and their mastery over creation itself.

For millennia, Guemenos thrived under the rule of the three eldest Edrahil, each one presiding over a distinct realm within the twisted tapestry of the world. The land teemed with life, albeit with twisted accents, and the inhabitants lived in a delicate balance between awe and terror. The Edrahil were revered as gods, their presence feared and worshipped by the lesser beings who lived in the three realms.

But deep within the heart of Guemenos, a foreboding darkness stirred. The cosmic fabric that held this twisted realm together quivered with an otherworldly anticipation, whispering of a lurking menace that threatened to shatter the fragile equilibrium. Shadows loomed larger, madness dripped like poison from the air, and whispers of an ancient, eldritch force began to echo through the ethereal halls of Guemenos.

### Iopothae
`0 to 5500 Iopothae Time (IT)`

The kingdom of Iopothae stood as a testament to the Edrahil's mastery, surpassing all others in its ingenuity and sophistication, a beacon of advanced knowledge and arcane arts. Towering spires of obsidian and basalt pierced the heavens, their blackened peaks scraping against the ethereal veil. Marble palaces, adorned with intricate carvings that whispered tales of forgotten gods, sprawled across the landscape, testifying to the might and ambition of the Iopothaeans. It was here that the first recorded calendar was meticulously crafted, its intricate markings etched upon ancient stones known as Chronoliths, unraveling the mysteries of time itself.

Chief among their astonishing creations was the [Ammuinoth](../realms.md#Ammuinoth), a colossal subterranean structure, its true purpose veiled in mystery. This titanic structure, comprised of intricate tunnels and temples, many hummed with a potent energy, drawing whispers of ancient powers that slumbered within its heart. It served as both a symbol of Iopothae's prowess and a reminder of the depths to which their hubris had driven them.

Little did they know that their relentless pursuit of supremacy would beckon forth forces from realms unseen, as dark entities stirred, their insidious tendrils creeping ever closer to the heart of Iopothae. In the realm of Iopothae, the seeds of their own downfall had been sown, and the price for their audacity would soon be demanded in full.

## The Kyri
`4500 to 17000 IT`

After the Kyri were awoken they started shaping the Ophaire as they saw fit, and created their own races while corrupting surface races and bringing them to the depthness of the world. It is in 6000 IT when the dragons, aberrations, fiends and ooze creatures started populating Guemenos' darkness. Around 7000 IT the Kyri and their creatures started attacking Edraihil's domains, and what is known as the War for Guemenos started.

The war lasted more than 10 thousand years and covered Guemenos with death, fire and suffering. Around the year 17000 IT, Ulkrunnar's son Gronz created a staff that had the power to obliterate large armies using a light power known as Uli.

Gronz used his staff for hundreds of years and was able to eliminate all the large armies from Nek's followers. The staff was not enough for killing Nek and his gods, but it was enough to weaken them. They were later imprisoned by Ulkrunnar in his Forsaken Hall, under the fortress of Turnskull (located in the ice sheets in the south pole). For the non divine inhabitants, although it was thought they were killed, they were rather sent to a world they called Acrisius. The use of the staff was called The Great Purge, but this history is unknown to most current inhabitants.

### The great purge

Part 1 (Draconic)

In eons past, the Kyri did awaken,
And molded Ophaire to their heart's desire,
They wrought their races and from the surface taken,
Those they corrupted with their twisted fire.

For centuries, the creatures of the dark,
The dragons, fiends, and ooze, they did thrive,
In Guemenos, the world's blackened mark,
Where Kyri and their kin waged war to survive.

Ten thousand years of darkness did ensue,
The land awash with death and endless pain,
Edraihil's domains were torn in two,
As Kyri armies marched, with war their reign.

Then Gronz, Ulkrunnar's son, did create,
A staff of light that could destroy the foe,
For hundreds of years, he did oblate,
Nek's followers theurgic fatal blow.

Part 2 (Celestial)

But Nek and his gods, they did survive,
Though weakened by the Great Purge's fire,
In Forsaken Hall, they did abide,
Deep below the fortress of Turnskull's spire.

For immortals, though, a fate worse than death,
To Acrisius, they were cast away,
A world unknown, where they drew their breath,
Forevermore, in darkness they would stay.

And so the world continued on,
In darkness, death, and endless pain,
The Great Purge's memory long gone,
As life in darkness did remain.

### Puppet masters
`17000 to 25000 IT, also known as 10000 to 18000 Time of the Kyri (TK)`

With Guemenos cleared out of the Edraihil, the Kyri started to shape the world to their liking. Many of the Kyri were amused by their power to silently corrupt peaceful civilisations and drive them to evil doings. This corruption became a game the evil gods played with the living creatures for thousands of years.

Around the year 13000 TK, Ulkrunnar's daughter Merdijad devised a plan to conquer the remaining races or Guemenos by religion (even religions that follow Nek's imprisoned deities), culture and a network of multi-tiered treaties between different kingdoms and races. This plan is known as The Silk. In 18000 TK, most of the large civilisations are not aware of the indirect control by Turnskull, under Merdijad rule. During these milenia Merdijad has also installed her commander, Lorqiroth, in the D'elsinese Empire.

### Wuvarax's passage to Arkul

Merdijad's and Gronz' brother, Wuvarax, being drawn by his jealousy of Merdijad's control scheme and Gronz staff, decided to come up with something as powerful and important as his siblings' ideas. He worked for hundreds of years with his sect of mages and dark clerics and built a portal in the castle of Atfordbury, in the Duchy of Hinckley. This portal enabled Wuvarax to move armies and peoples to the inhabited world of Arkul. Wuvarax and his followers begin to form a civilisation in Arkul, to protect Ulkrunnar's followers in case the world of Guemenos was reconquered by Nek's followers.

## Absent children of Nek

Nek's children gods were imprisoned by Gronz, and it was for minor deities such as Mystra, Bonnalurie, Falet and Kimbarak to envision a plan to regain Guemenos. These three gods have hold conclaves every a thousand years in Acrisius, where their plan is revised and put in practice. In the 6th conclave Bonnalurie proposed the New Calender to start - it was implemented in the 7th conclave (8000 AT).

### Acrisius

In Acrisius, Nek's followers (now known as Acrisae) started from scratch, to build again all their technology and magic, while developing a strong and unbeatable army. For the Acrisae, this was the year 0 of the Acrisius time (AT).

### The Reclaim Campaign
`Starting in 1150 AT, or 3499 of the New Calendar (NC)`

Around the year 11500 AT, known in Guemenos as 3499 of the new calendar (NC), the Acrisae started executing their plan to reclaim Guemenos. Their first scouts came from Acrisius leveraging the same Uli power, reverse-engineering from the information Bonnalurie collected when she faced the same power from the staff. Bonnalurie built 10 rings that enabled the scouts to travel to Guemenos. They've scouted Guemenos until 3855 NC when they travelled back to Acrisius to further advance the plan. By then, Bonnalurie had developed the portal opening machines that look like golden mechanical dragons, the Sulpraxae. 

The first stage of the campaign is to arrive in the barren plains of the Tolfoddund county, south of the Naragzah mountains, in the Khathan Empire and set up a large scale military camp. 

The location will be chosen so that access to Ammuinoth is possible, and the construction can be used to disguise Acrisae operations such as mining, construction and training. To make sure the region is empty of curious eyes, the Acrisae, with support from the Sulpraxae, will cause fear to the region inhabitants by scorching the earth and forcing them to neighbouring regions, including the mountains and its caves and mines.

![](https://i.imgur.com/svplP5E.png)

It would cause suffering to the inhabitants of the region, but a large enough proportion can save themselves and create a new life for them. After the final conflict with the Kyri is finished, the world would be free of Ulkrunnar and his children. To the Acrisae that seems like an acceptable trade off.

In the year 3877 NC dozens of Sulpraxae and thousands of soldiers from the Acrisae army arrived in Guemenos. These soldiers will spend most of the first 5 years making sure the tribes of the region are driven off, and setting up the first encampment - which would then be developed into a large city state fortress - which would take 20 years more (and would be finished ~3902 NC). The plan is then for the city state would then be connected to the northwesterly civilisations with roads (100 km per year), economic and military treaties. 

Sulpraxae can use the Uli power to scorch the land, raising temperatures to above 60C temporarily, and keeping them around 50C for years, if necessary. The intent is to stop scorching after the first 5 years, but maintain pressure on people to not come close to the chosen place of the city-state, with targeted attacks when necessary.
