# Secrets for Realms of Guemenos

## Katho

### Linhe

**Genre**: [dark fantasy](https://5e.tools/book.html#vrgr,-1,dark%20fantasy,0), [folk](https://5e.tools/book.html#vrgr,-1,folk%20horror,0_) and [disaster](https://5e.tools/book.html#vrgr,-1,disaster%20horror,0) horror
**Hallmarks**: Dwindling resources, fickle hero worship, impending disaster, suspicion, totalitarianism, undead
**Technology: 2** Weapons and armour have evolved and medium armour is common, heavy armour is rare.
**Magic: 3** Rare. While it is uncommon for a mage to be killed outright, the use of magic in common areas is taboo.
**Political: 2** Empires have consolidated power, or a fall of a great empire fractures the land politically with a common culture.

Linhe is a land besieged. Empty countryside surrounds ruined or crumbling cities. A few desperate pockets of civilisation survive, carrying on not out of hope, but, in most of the region, out of fear of the FFKA's merciless members. Led by [Sergarus](sergarus.md), the paramilitary group organises a desperate and occasionally effective defence against an implacable foe: the ever-growing armies of the dead.

Where the FFKA East is strong, it has turned against the people, making them prisoners within their own country. With cudgel and pike, the soldiers of Falet force every commoner into gruelling labor, rushing them to raise fortifications and scrape ruins from the dirt. Every lash strike, every day of meagre rations is necessary - or so the soldiers claim - because time is short and the undead are coming.

Every few months a new zombie legion issues from the Ghost Domain through caves and cracks in the wastelands. Never emerging from the same place twice, the horde sweeps across the land, drawn to the densest populations of the living. Causalities stack up during the zombie sieges, but miracles and moments of valour have not abandoned Linhe. The people's numbers dwindle, but they soldier on. In the aftermath of an attack, the Linhans burn their dead, repair what they can, and whisper that now might be the time to flee. Invariably, though, someone speaks too loudly and a so-called traitor is impaled upon city walls.

**Noteworthy Features:**
- Every few months, close to the night of the new moon, hordes of undead appear from the Ghost Domain and invade Linhe.
- Old and new ruins cover Linhe - cities and villages crushed by zombie hordes and haunted by undead stragglers.
- FFKA soldiers patrol the land, hunting for deserters, looters, and strangers to press into service. Non-compliance is punished with impalement.
- Individuals earn public or military esteem for special acts of heroism. Dubbed "Trueborn of Linhe," these heroes are treated well, but the fickle public turns against them if they're perceived as not doing enough to end the undead invasion.

## Nurderad

I grew up in Djerad Thymar the capital city of the Nurdead Prececture. Djerad Thymar was considered by some as a renowned place throughout the kingdom of Foucheresia for its incredible size, unique shape, and virtually impenetrable architecture. Unique in its design, the entire city was one giant hollow pyramid, that rested on a granite foundation supported by a huge number of columns. The top of the pyramid reached 1,500 feet (460 meters) into the sky. A wide ramp was the only land entrance to the pyramid. The city was surrounded by a few farms and homesteads, as well as by the private states of the wealthy clans, which usually were built in Lopothae ruins near to Djerad Thymar. Djerad Thymar was ruled by the Vanquisher, who also ruled all of Tymanther. 

## Olivepia

Olivepia's king is an usurper. Olivepia has prohibition on magic. Olivepia is based in 1400- Portugal, with a lot of influence, science, but also strong inquisition and religious violence against non-humans.

## Underdark

Although the Kyri power touched the drow and duergar before, it was only when the most evil creatures living the Ophaire explored the depths of Shadowfell that the Kyri themselves were awoken. The story is not fully known, but it is said 4500 IT is when Ulkrunnar and his sons and daughters became active in Guemenos.

## Deadecho

The Deadecho, the dominion of [Algath](../context/religions.md#Algath) (and the equally notorious Vardesain and Anu-Akma, fellow demigods of the dead), is notable for its silence - an existence of enormous deserts of bones, dunes of dust, and rivers of blood and tears. These are the dry lands, where life extends past its appointed span, where fate itself is thwarted with regularity, and where liches, vampires, and ghouls gather in enormous numbers to praise their patron and the font of vileness, to cheat death, to praise their protection against a certain voyage into the hells and the joy and strength of the god of the undead and his near-infinite legions.

Deadecho, Plane of Undeath (MWB 46) - Evermaw is confused with the Eleven Hells, since it is an afterlife of ghouls and vampires, cannibals and gluttons. A road like a lolling tongue sprawls through a waterless desert of blood dust, passing towers that sprout like crooked white teeth, until it’s swallowed by the gulletlike sinkhole that houses the city of Vulture’s Beyond, osseous capital of the Hunger God Vardesain, as well as the Eternal Palace of the dry undead lord Mot and the Crystal Necropolis of the guardian god Anu-Akma. Here ziggurats flow with the blood of daily sacrifices, liches study new necromancies of flesh and bone, and the cooks claim they can skin and butcher anything, from ghosts to gods.
