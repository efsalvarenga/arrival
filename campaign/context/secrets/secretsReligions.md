# Secrets for Religion

## Kimbarak 

But little did they know the horror that lurked within his past.

Long before he took up residence in the Kiranu mountains, Kimbarak had been trapped in the depths of the Ophaire, a place of darkness and terror where demons and horrors roamed free. For years, he had fought to survive, his body battered and his spirit broken by the constant onslaught of demonic attacks. But somehow, through sheer force of will, Kimbarak had managed to escape, his spirit shattered and his mind twisted by the horrors he had endured. He fled to the safety of the Kiranu mountains, vowing to protect his fellow dwarves at all costs.

At first, the dwarves welcomed him as a hero, ignorant of the darkness that lurked within his soul. But as the years passed, they began to notice a change in Kimbarak - a coldness, a detachment that had not been there before. And then, the nightmares began. Dwarves would wake in the middle of the night, screaming in terror as they relived the horrors of the Ophaire through Kimbarak's twisted memories. They would see the demons, hear their screams, and feel their claws tearing at their flesh.

Kimbarak himself was immune to the nightmares, his mind already consumed by the darkness that had taken hold of him. He would sit for hours, staring into the darkness, muttering to himself in a language no one could understand. The dwarves began to fear Kimbarak, but they were powerless to stop him. He was too powerful, too entrenched in the mountains to be dislodged. And so they continued to live in fear, never knowing when Kimbarak's inner demons would be unleashed upon them.

For Kimbarak, there was no redemption, no salvation. He was forever trapped in the darkness of the Ophaire, his mind consumed by the horrors he had endured. And so he remained, a powerful, twisted, and horrifying presence in the Kiranu mountains, forever haunting the dreams and nightmares of those he had sworn to protect.

***The Fall of Kimbarak***

Oh, hear me now, and listen to my tale,
Of Kimbarak, the dwarf with spirit frail,
Long trapped in depths of Ophaire's dread,
Where demons and horrors roamed and fed.

For years, he fought to live and breathe,
His body battered, his spirit beneath,
The constant onslaught of demonic might,
Left him shattered, twisted by the blight.

Through sheer force of will, he did escape,
But in his soul, the darkness did take shape,
To Kiranu's safety, he did flee,
To protect his kin, forevermore be.

At first, he was hailed as hero grand,
But soon, they saw his spirit's demand,
A coldness, detachment, they could not ignore,
As Kimbarak's soul, in darkness, did explore.

Then came the nightmares, oh, wretched fate,
Dwarves screaming, reliving Ophaire's hate,
Demons, claws, and screams in their mind,
Kimbarak's twisted memories they did find.

Yet, Kimbarak himself, immune to the pain,
His mind consumed, nothing to gain,
Hours spent, staring into the night,
Muttering in a language, out of sight.

The dwarves lived in fear, powerless, to be,
As Kimbarak's demons, set to be free,
Trapped in the mountains, entrenched in his hold,
His inner darkness, ever so bold.

No redemption, no salvation for he,
Forever trapped, in Ophaire's misery,
Twisted, powerful, and forever more,
Haunting the dreams, of those he swore.

## Mondendovil

Through ages of empire and conflict, the Illithid elder brains indulged experiments without comparison or reference for lesser beings, explorations beyond the boundaries of time, reality, life and death. Many failed. To summarise an eon of atrocities, one elder brain's reality-bending research had an unexpected result, revealing to it a malignant truth for which existence was unprepared. Guided by this burgeoning revelation, the elder brain turned and preyed upon its peers, consuming their discoveries and their physical forms to fuel an impossible apotheosis, and was then expelled to the Void, ultimately becoming Mondendovil.
