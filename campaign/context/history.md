# The History of Terra

## Silent Legions
***19th and 20th centuries AC***

First encounters with Outsiders on Earth. These encounters are rare, unobtrusive and mostly modest in scope. Early eldritch rituals and proto-psionic powers are discovered, but mostly unreliable.


## Golden Age of Men
***22nd to 27th centuries AC (swn120-127)***

Early spike drive space travel starts through shallow meta-dimensional courses, triggering the emergence of strong psionic powers in humans. Two centuries later, Psitech development enables jump gate space travel, leveraging deep meta-dimensional courses. Terran society reached its greatest expanse, possibly signalling its existence to ancient alien species. In its peak, development is broken by the first crisis - known as The Scream.


## The Great Silence
***27th to 32nd centuries AC***

The majority of the worlds are severed from each other, with no working logistics and communications systems to integrate them. Human societies make what they can with degrading technologies. 


## Sorcerer-Kings Era
***One million years***

In human societies, eldritch disciplines are now the relevant powers, with psionic powers left for pariahs and Outsiders - who are chased and killed. Several schools of magic prosper, one at a time. Each overcomes the previous one, reaches some kind of apex and then, somehow, trigger some universe control mechanism that starts new crises and dark ages. An unaccounted number of these cycles happened, and many of the schools of magic have been completely lost.

The end of the Sorcerer-Kings Era, known as the Cerulean Cycle, brought the age of Dragon-Kings, who were then able to fuse eldritch disciplines with psionic powers. These individuals were the most powerful of any other that ever existed, and were revered as gods by cults on the civilised city states on Earth.


## The Celestial Storm
***20 millenia***

The Dragon-Kings breached Heaven, from where reality and meta-dimensional channels were operated. The kings searched for the creator of reality but found the throne empty. The celestial engines were operated by Angels, and in an act of fury the kings decided to vandalise Heaven. That did not go unpunished, and a war between the Angels and the Dragon-Kings ensued, culminating with the Earth scattered in pieces alongside uncreated reality. The universe was broken.

After the Dragon-Kings demise, other powerful sorcerers took their place, and used the stolen shards of heaven and eldritch rituals to weave the Made Gods. These divine powers finally uncreated Heaven itself. But with that, reality also became broken. Some Angels took lair in Earth itself, with most eventually waning in power and becoming proto-elves. A handful were able to maintain their power and proclaimed themselves as **The Edrahil**.


## The Legacy
***400 millenia***

A lot in unknown about this period, but what is known is that the remaining sorcerers on Earth were able to use their eldritch powers to weave a new fabric for reality. This new fabric became known as The Legacy and the sorcerers who created it became known as The Weavers.


## Outsider Rulers
***700 millenia***

The weakened humanity was overrun by waves of Outsider invasions, which conquered Earth one after the other. These Outsiders mostly battle amongst themselves, and humanity was driven to the deeps of Earth. During this era, a few remaining sorcerer-kings further their power through Outsider knowledge, and these became known as **The Kyri**.

The Outsider powers, in the end, was defeated by The Legacy, and most of these species fled Terra.


## Latter Earth
***Last 4 millenia***

Some celestial power attempted to break the Legacy, but some kind of defence protocol was activated. This became known as the Colligation of Time.


# Uncanny powers in the universe

## Primary disciplines

### Eldritch
***Later known as The Legacy***

High magic, necromancy, etc. All of them channel universe energies similarly. Eldritch powers are known to be mostly accessible to humans and demihumans. The legacy is the current power responsible to maintain world realities in place, avoiding further uncreation. The original legacy writers are now gone, and knowledge on the legacy workings is mostly incomplete.

### Psionic
***Later developed into Psitech***

Originated in the golden age of man (possibly also in alien races), now mostly inaccessible to humans. Some ancient alien races can still operate Psitech to a limited extent.

### Celestial

Originated by creatures known as Angels, in higher metadimensional spaces (heavens). Men first sight of it was during the invasion of heaven. Celestial is the technology what kept the metadimensional space in order, but it is currently mostly shattered. Only Angels fully understand it - and most of them do not care about worlds anymore.

## Derivative disciplines

### Cerulean
***Psionic and eldritch***

Discipline in the age of the dragon-kings.

### Theotechnology
***Eldritch and Celestial***

Humans were able to open exceptions in the Legacy that allowed them to bind celestial shards (stolen from the heavens) and Eldritch powers in creatures known as Made Gods. Legend speaks of sparks of Theotechnology awakening individuals (Godbounds).


# Stories of Creation

## The Creation

In the darkness of a forgotten universe, the world of Guemenos was born from the hand of Nek, a deity who crafted its very foundations. With its inception, Nek gifted the realm with an intricate tapestry of energy known as Theurgy, an otherworldly power that pulsed through the fabric of existence.

Intriguingly, the powers of Theurgy took on a life of their own, self-organising and imbuing Guemenos with life, birthing an array of creatures that spanned its domains. Among these enigmatic beings were the Weavers, ethereal races forged from the very essence of Theurgy itself. They embodied the raw potential of this arcane energy, possessing a mastery that surpassed mortal comprehension.

Over the course of centuries, the Weavers delved into the mysteries of Theurgy, researching deeper into its enigmatic depths. Through their relentless work, they unlocked the secrets of Theotechnical engines, wondrous devices that harnessed and channeled the boundless power of Theurgy. With each invention, Guemenos flourished, and its inhabitants revelled in the marvels that these devices wrought.

## Of Weavers and Angels

As is often the way with great power, discord brewed amidst the Weavers. Their divergent beliefs clashed, and the realm was consumed by the ravages of imperial wars that scarred the land for ages untold. Seeking resolution, the Weavers convened in a grand council, their intentions set upon parlaying with the enigmatic Nek himself, hoping to find a common ground and end the strife that plagued their world.

In their anticipation, the Weavers ventured to Nek's halls, expecting to encounter the deity himself. To their dismay, they were instead greeted by the ethereal presence of Angels, emissaries of Nek. Betrayal dripped from the air as the Weavers realised that Nek had shunned their entreaties, substituting his own celestial messengers in his stead.

Enraged by this apparent treachery, the Weavers vowed to rise above Nek and his celestial minions. They intensified their efforts, seeking to augment their Theotechnical engines to surpass the power of Nek and the Angels. Alas, their ambitions would be dashed against the shores of fate, for the Angels, envious of the world Nek had woven for the Weavers and lesser races, devised a plan to seize Guemenos for themselves.

Eons of bloodshed ensued as the Angels waged relentless war against the Weavers. The heavens trembled with their clash, and the inevitable came to passâ€”the Angels emerged victorious. They claimed Guemenos as their own, declaring themselves The Edraihil, the self-proclaimed sons and daughters of Nek.

Banished to the depths of the world they once called home, the Weavers and their peoples retreated, their powers simmering in the shadows. For millennia, their knowledge and strength melded in the crucible of isolation, ultimately culminating in the construction of the Kyri. This powerful forged pantheon stood as a testament to their tenacity, a bastion of power to reclaim what had been taken.

As the ages unfolded, most of the Edraihil gradually waned in power, their once celestial forms degraded into mere shadows of their former glory. Yet, a select few endured, ascending to blessed stature, their essence resonating with the divine. These remnants of the Edraihil persisted as powerful beings, revered and feared by those who dared cross their path. A chapter in the grand tapestry of Guemenos had closed, while another, steeped in dark intrigue and ancient grudges, unfurled in the depths below.

## The rule of the Edraihil

The Edrahil, their power solidified and their dominion unchallenged, reshaped Guemenos in the image of their celestial progenitor, Nek. With intricate incantations and unfathomable rituals, they twisted the very fabric of reality, moulding the land to reflect their desires. Mountains rose like jagged fangs, rivers twisted and turned in unnerving patterns, and forests whispered secrets that only the chosen few could decipher.

In their divine fervour, the Edrahil bestowed life upon new creatures, imbuing them with aspects that paid homage to their own divine essence. From the writhing depths of the oceans to the desolate expanse of the deserts, monstrous beings were a grotesque reflection of their creators, bearing distorted features and unearthly forms. These abominations roamed, forever serving as a testament to the Edrahil's power and their mastery over creation itself.

For millennia, Guemenos thrived under the rule of the three eldest Edrahil, each one presiding over a distinct realm within the twisted tapestry of the world. The land teemed with life, albeit with twisted accents, and the inhabitants lived in a delicate balance between awe and terror. The Edrahil were revered as gods, their presence feared and worshipped by the lesser beings who lived in the three realms.

But deep within the heart of Guemenos, a foreboding darkness stirred. The cosmic fabric that held this twisted realm together quivered with an otherworldly anticipation, whispering of a lurking menace that threatened to shatter the fragile equilibrium. Shadows loomed larger, madness dripped like poison from the air, and whispers of an ancient, eldritch force began to echo through the ethereal halls of Guemenos.

### Iopothae

The kingdom of Iopothae stood as a testament to the Edrahil's mastery, surpassing all others in its ingenuity and sophistication, a beacon of advanced knowledge and arcane arts. Towering spires of obsidian and basalt pierced the heavens, their blackened peaks scraping against the ethereal veil. Marble palaces, adorned with intricate carvings that whispered tales of forgotten gods, sprawled across the landscape, testifying to the might and ambition of the Iopothaeans. It was here that the first recorded calendar was meticulously crafted, its intricate markings etched upon ancient stones known as Chronoliths, unraveling the mysteries of time itself.

Chief among their astonishing creations was the [Ammuinoth](../realms.md#Ammuinoth), a colossal subterranean structure, its true purpose veiled in mystery. This titanic structure, comprised of intricate tunnels and temples, many hummed with a potent energy, drawing whispers of ancient powers that slumbered within its heart. It served as both a symbol of Iopothae's prowess and a reminder of the depths to which their hubris had driven them.

Little did they know that their relentless pursuit of supremacy would beckon forth forces from realms unseen, as dark entities stirred, their insidious tendrils creeping ever closer to the heart of Iopothae. In the realm of Iopothae, the seeds of their own downfall had been sown, and the price for their audacity would soon be demanded in full.
