# Faithful Faletist Knights of the Arch, East Branch

## Court

- **Type**: Temple
- **Power structure**: Figurehead. A public leader is actually controlled by one or more hidden figures.
- **Temperament**: Careless, members little interested in spiritual duties
- **Major actors**
	- [Sergarus](../npcs/sergarus.md), who is in partnership with some of the [Mercians](mercians.md)
	- Aged holy figure, who controls a vital relic of the religion - the actual leader
	- Eager reformer, who has strong magical powers and wants to drive the organisation out of main FFKA
- **Minor actors**
	- Relic vendor
	- Dusty librarian
- **Conflicts**
	- Lack of trust in the figurehead.
- **Consequence of its destruction**: some cities depend on the organisation charity, which would not be taken by Olivepia's FFKA.
- **Defences**: strong military organisation

## Faction
