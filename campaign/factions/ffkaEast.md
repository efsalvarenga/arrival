# Faithful Faletist Knights of the Arch, East Branch

## Court

- **Type**: Temple
- **Power structure**: Figurehead. A public leader is actually controlled by one or more hidden figures.
- **Temperament**: Careless, members little interested in spiritual duties
- **Major actors**
	- [Sergarus](../npcs/sergarus.md), who is in partnership with some of the [Mercians](mercians.md)
	- Aged holy figure, who controls a vital relic of the religion - the actual leader
	- Eager reformer, who has strong magical powers and wants to drive the organisation out of main FFKA
- **Minor actors**
	- Relic vendor
	- Dusty librarian
- **Conflicts**
	- Lack of trust in the figurehead.
- **Consequence of its destruction**: some cities depend on the organisation charity, which would not be taken by Olivepia's FFKA.
- **Defences**: strong military organisation

## Faction

- **Features**:
	- Faithful followers and members
	- Organised military organisation
- **Trouble**:
	- Sergarus, the commander, is not in good relationship with Olivepia's FFKA (1 pt)
	- Deflection of members to the Dark Cavalry (1 pt)
	- Many members do not trust Sergarus anymore, and are very uncomfortable with the impalements (1 pt)
- **Goals**
	- [ ] Remove problem: Strengthen its hold on its members (cost 4: city + skilled mage opposition - Gellert, plausible)
