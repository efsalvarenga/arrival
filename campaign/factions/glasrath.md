After the large battle with the undead, the military units of the cities of Watheton, Gorthugke, Gamunz and Tolfoddund joined forces with the Delmuth people (drows from the Ghost Domain) and the Nargun. They were victorious, but with strong losses.

* Watheton: Nosbelbeyn and Ondor perished, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">their units are gone</span>.
* Gorthugke: **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Ghuse survived</span>**, Umryn and Tristhil perished. They have left 69 Inf3 and 25 Inf2Arch.
* Tolfoddund: Sin-shar-ishkun and Gunk perished. They have left 24 Inf3.
* Gamunz: **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Singlestrike and Serhan survived</span>**, Umonar perished. They have left 9 Inf3, 98 Inf2, 46 Inf2Arch and 7 Inf1.
* Nargun: **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Umimnumi and Whursock (new regent) survived</span>**. Sitmeak perished. They have left 103 Inf3 and 20 Inf2Arch.
* Delmuth: **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Theklurth is missing in combat</span>**. Yncyn perished. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Their units are gone.</span>

The new organisation of the Glasrath Alliance is:

* King regent: Whursock Greybow (Nargun)
* Guard Regiment Capitain: Serhan (Gamunz)
* Mayor for the mines and city: Singlestrike (Gamunz)
* Army General and Cleric of Algath: Ghuse
* Army soldiers: 205 Inf3, 91 Inf2Arch, 50 Inf2
* Guards: 48 Inf2 and 7 Inf1
* Civilians from all the cities: 13.000.

1. Turf > 3: starts having large festivities celebrating Algath: ¼ of the leadership and population is in full support.
2. Turf > 6: number of undead greatly surpasses the number of alive people (2-to-1), mostly working the mines: ½ of the leadership (lowest turf factions) and population is in full support - if characters haven't noticed yet, they notice now, that people are looking more pale and seem a bit brain drained.
3. Turf > 9: known people from the first days of the alliance are raised, including the dragon and Fuko - ¾ of the leadership and population is in full support.
4. Turf = 12: the alliance is now Ghuse's, and he turns to his Aivrindyt form now.

How PCs can slow down Ghuse's ascension:



* If they actively foil Ghuse, Ghuse's tenacity is reduced
* If they actively strengthen one of the other factions, their tenacity is increased
* If they appoint a new leader (from outside the current alliance), another faction can be created and take over some of the turf
* If they kill Ghuse/Aivrindyt.
