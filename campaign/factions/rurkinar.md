# Rurkinar Cultists

- **Features**
	- High shaman proven (druidic) powers, who can communicate with gods
	- Strong cult believers, protectors of Linhe
- **Trouble**
	- Lost their strongest ally - the Angel Hond (1 pt)
	- Are losing followers to the FFKA fast (1 pt)
	- Are in general afraid, that something dark is brewing in the air (1 pt)
	- High Shaman is troubled (acquired from a foil from FFKA East in [3877.5B](_factionGame.md#3877.5B))
	- something else because of new feature.... roleplay during chap 7: maybe the Shamans are killed, or many followers are killed in a fight with FFKA?

- **Goals**
	- [x] Feature: communication with Rurkinar and find the Angel Hound (cost 2: village, implausible). Succeeded in 3877.5B.
	- [ ] Reduce problems

## Court

- **Type**: Community
- **Power structure**: autocratic (Chieftain has largely unchallenged control)
- **Temperament**: Insular, polite but reluctant to deal with strangers
- **Major actors**
	- Otaehryn Valdove, male dust goblin [chieftain](https://open5e.com/monsters/dust-goblin-chieftain): very personally formidable in a fight
	- Imra Advyre, female dust elf high [shaman](https://open5e.com/monsters/junk-shaman): have a huge family that backs them. She is old and looks slighly mad. ^imraAdvyre
- **Minor actors**
	- Dirue Petmaris, female halfling old [shaman](https://open5e.com/monsters/junk-shaman): outcast, suspected of crow magic
	- Ailen Eilpetor (male human [cultist](https://open5e.com/monsters/cultist-a5e) ) leads a group of young cultists: who is a barflies, and hears too much gossip
- **Conflicts**
	- The kin of the Otaehryn (chieftan) is missing, and Ailen (barfly) tells it was Dirue (outcast) who did it. 
- **Consequence of its destruction**: The dust elf trade link will collapse
- **Defences**: a mob of angry [peasants](https://open5e.com/monsters/commoner)

## Details

![Rurkinar, the Brown Eagle](../context/religions.md#Rurkinar)

They have currently lost the Angel Hound, a major spirt ally. The Angel Hound has been imprisoned in the [Holzander Castle](../locations/holzanderCastle.md) since 3871 NC. Although the Yotunn are in conflict with the Trow in the southwest, this has very little direct impact on the Rurkinar.
