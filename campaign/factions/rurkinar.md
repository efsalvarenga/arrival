## Details

![Rurkinar, the Brown Eagle](../religions.md#Rurkinar,%20the%20Brown%20Eagle)

They have currently lost the Angel Hound, a major spirt ally. The Angel Hound has been imprisoned in the [Holzander Castle](../locations/holzanderCastle.md) since 3871 NC. Although the Yotunn are in conflict with the Trow in the southwest, this has very little direct impact on the Rurkinar.
