## Details

Rurkinar, the Brown Eagle, is the second highest deity in Mystra's pantheon - which is the most important pantheon of the Yotunn Ancestors folk religion group. The Rurkinar followers, and cultists, are the most relevant Yotunn representation on the northeast (to the east of Mystra's).

The Rurkinar Cultists are a group of shamans that believe in direct communication with the Brown Eagle through rituals. They have currently lost the Angel Hound, a major spirt ally. The Angel Hound has been imprisoned in the [Holzander Castle](../locations/holzanderCastle.md) since 3871 NC. Although the Yotunn are in conflict with the Trow in the southwest, this has very little direct impact on the Rurkinar.
