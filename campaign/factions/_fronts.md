# Large fronts

> Source: Lazy DM

Acrisae and Turnskull: 7 fronts in total, 3 each plus the deflagration of full war.

Roll a d20 every time party level reaches a new integer (from 6 onwards), against DC 11. On a success one front advances. Randomly assign which front advances, but the 7th front is always the last - and it should happen at level 20 latest.

Statistically this gives the following distribution:

| Quantile | Party level at 7th front |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| 10%      | 15                       |
| 30%      | 17                       |
| 50%      | 19                       |
| 100%     | 20                       |
