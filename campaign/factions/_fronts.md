# Large Fronts

## Rules

Roll a d20 every time party level reaches a new integer (from 5 onwards), against DC 11. On a success one front advances. Randomly assign which front advances, but the 7th front is always the last - and it should happen at level 20 latest.

Statistically this gives the following distribution:

| Quantile | Party level at 7th front |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| 10%      | 15                       |
| 30%      | 17                       |
| 50%      | 19                       |
| 100%     | 20                       |

## Milestones

### Fronts 1/8

First front was the arrival.

Acrisae and Turnskull: 7 more fronts in total, 3 each plus the deflagration of full war. Share with the players the moment each front advances (i.e. the campaign has 8 milestones for completion), and make it happen after some action of the PCs on the world.

**Acrisae fronts**
- [ ] Supraxae are now flying everywhere to maintain reconnaissance 
- [ ] Acrisae establish lines to the west with other civilisations to prepare for the war (Avryindt is in the way) - start Acrisae faction
- [ ] Acrisae brings military positioning to the surface and redies for war

**Turnskull fronts**
- [ ] Part 3 starts: Khato's armies lose in the south, Kiranu and others will need to migrate north - start Turnskull faction game for measuring it's expansion 
- [ ] Part 4 starts: Big freeze from the south
- [ ] Part 5 starts: Turnskull takes the entirety of south Etor, ready for war
