# Large Fronts

## Rules

Roll a d20 every time party level reaches a new integer (from 6 onwards), against DC 11. On a success one front advances. Randomly assign which front advances, but the 7th front is always the last - and it should happen at level 20 latest.

Statistically this gives the following distribution:

| Quantile | Party level at 7th front |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| 10%      | 15                       |
| 30%      | 17                       |
| 50%      | 19                       |
| 100%     | 20                       |

## Fronts

Acrisae and Turnskull: 7 fronts in total, 3 each plus the deflagration of full war.

**Acrisae fronts**
- [ ] Supraxae are now flying everywhere to maintain reconnaissance 
- [ ] Acrisae establish lines to the west with other civilisations to prepare for the war (Avryindt is in the way)
- [ ] Acrisae brings military positioning to the surface and redies for war

**Turnskull fronts**
- [ ] Khato's armies lose in the south, Kiranu and others will need to migrate north
- [ ] Big freeze from the south
- [ ] Turnskull takes the entirety of south Etor, ready for war

**Party level and outcome**
- [ ] 5 (party went back):
- [ ] 6:
- [ ] 7: Foreshadowing for Part 3 - Supraxae is destroyed by Holzander's umbilical and falls
- [ ] 8: (mandatory 1st front) - think on active closure of Part 2 by PCs. Maybe battle with Ghost Riders? 
- [ ] 9: Foreshadowing for Part 3 - Thick mist starts
- [ ] 10: (mandatory 2nd front) - closes Part 2
