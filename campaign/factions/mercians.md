## Details

Mercians are the natural followers of Wuvurax. Many do so by following the folk polytheistic Mercian religion, of which Mondendovil is the forefather. But the religion itself lost influence in the last decades, with the expansion of Faletism from the west. However, even with the loss of religious influence, the cultural influence still persists strongly.

Mercian people are mostly humans, very cunning, and prefer to act on the background. Their influence also expands towards the Ghost Domain, where they lead a cavalry of Ghost Riders. The military strength is mostly used to avoid investigations from other groups on their works in Hincland (surface and subsurface). Most of the Mercian power comes from magic investigation. The faction intention is to expand its influence towards the southeast, and build a contiguous Ulkrunnar realm with Turnskull. When needed, they would also influence the FFKA in the east through an alliance with Sergarus.

Outside their strongest influence areas, mercians meet in what they call Mercian houses, and are very secretive.
