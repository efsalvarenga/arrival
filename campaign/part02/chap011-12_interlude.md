## Intro

- 

## Strong start

- You are all in a ship, navigating a starless and moonless night in a turbulent see.
- There are some light clouds in the sky.
- You are under the command of Kimbarak, a strong human sea captain, and you are in a "mission".
	- The ship top-rank crew consists of Kimbarak, first mate, quartermaster and a sailing master.
	- The crew of seafarers consists of 8 men, including the 3 PCs.
	- There is one cook and one carpenter.
- You see in distance a cyclopean island, which you know is what you've been looking for
- STR DC 6 to not fall from the ship because of the waves or docking

## Potential scenes

- *Intro* to investigation: Vorlak receives the PCs - he looks human, but something is wrong.
	- Vorlak is the community translator and he is **working on translating** a ritual from the **Forge Scriptorium Walls**
	- **PCs's mission is to spoil the ritual**
	- Vorlak **needs help to find Kalrov**, who bears the Angelic Sword, required for the ritual 
- *Investigation* A: **What is the ritual about?**
	- Vorlak explains the ritual is to bind Mondedovil to a physical form, so he stops harming the Ngar'tho
- #attention **Share the first image of the Ngar'tho**
- *Investigation* B: **Where is the ritual taking place**
	- Vorlak does not know yet, but it is written in the **Forge Scriptorium Walls**
- *Investigation* C: Translating the name of the location of the ritual from the Forge Scriptorium Walls
	- Requires Kalrov, who **does not have the Angelic Sword** - **Kimbarak has it**
- #attention **Share the second image of the Ngar'tho**
- *Resolution*: The ritual is found to happen on the **Eldritch Furnace**
	- Kimbarak asks the PCs to **distract the Ngar'tho so that he can spoil** the ritual, in a suicidal bid
	- The ritual was not to bind or free Mondedovil, but to use **Kimbarak to create the race of the dwarves** - who will now deliver the plan.
	- **Kimbarak dissolves** into the theurgical tapestry
- *Escape*: **Like Call of Cthulhu** - but now without Kimbarak
	- Mondedonvil chases the PCs
	- Kimbarak is found on the ship days later, as the first dwarf.

### Random encounters


## Relevant NPCs

### Kimbarak
***Chance at glory & earnest idiot***

They have a shot at fame, fortune, happiness, or some other situation they’ve longed to obtain - by stoping the ritual. Their plans and schemes might revolve around making an opening for their own reckless ambitions. They are a fool, unfortunately. This idiocy is not so constant or profound but sooner or later they’re going to make the worst possible decision at the worst possible time.
- **Aspirations** To spoil the ritual, proving he is not a fool
- **Powers** They have the required item for stoping the ritual. He is very charismatic.
- **Dreads** The glory is not attainable, the entire ritual is not as expected. He caused a disaster in bringing the item here.


### Vorlak
***Secret sectarian & doomed love***

They are a devotee of some faith, cause, or faction that must remain hidden from the world, either because their exposure would make them less useful to it, or because the group itself is unacceptable to society. Their ostensible schemes and duties actually are meant to support their secret allies.

Conversely, they may be supported by this secret faction without ever realizing that it is the case. Powerful allies or useful underlings may act to aid them, as their purpose is somehow advantageous to the sect.

A Make the sect an open power in the region, Discharge some great debt or obligation they have to the sect, Destroy an enemy of the sect without making their affiliation obvious

P The sect gives them valuable resources or items, Their devotion has allowed them to obtain magical gifts, Hidden devotees of the sect act to aid their open purposes

D The sect considers them a disposable weapon for the cause, A rival threatens to reveal their affiliation to the public, Their current duty would be disastrous for the sect if they carried it out correctly

They are passionately in love with a person who is either utterly unobtainable, wholly disinterested in their devotion, or profoundly unhealthy in their affections. Their motivations revolve around winning or keeping this person’s heart, yet they have no plausible chance of getting their desire.

Conversely, they may be the unwilling object of another’s mad devotion, forced to manage the ardor of someone they cannot imagine loving.

A Destroy some enemy or rival of the loved one, Perform a grand deed to win the loved one’s admiration, Engineer a situation to blackmail or compel the loved one to recognize their devotion

P Some power finds it profitable to encourage and support this vain romance, Their burning devotion has inspired their greatest efforts, They’ve made terrible pacts or bargains to win help in their cause

D Their beloved finds personal benefit in leading them on interminably, Some rival in love moves to quash their competitor, Some third party threatens to harm or steal away the object of their love


### Kalrov
***Inherited duty & ticking bomb***

They have a task or social role that they received from their ancestors, either as a personal grudge or obligation or as part of some broader societal expectation. They have never had any say in this duty, and carrying it out has cost them dearly in the past.

Conversely, they may have this duty but have absolutely no intention of carrying it out, or they may be utilizing it purely as an excuse to satisfy their own goals with no concern for dutiful service.

A Finally complete the job and be free to do as they wish, Foist the duty off on someone else, Get revenge on the people or society that forced the duty on them

P They are aided by others in the same social role or who have the same duty, They were trained to be extremely good at their job, They’ve inherited some item or resource to help them do their task

D Carrying out the duty properly means doing something they find wicked or emotionally intolerable, If they carry out the duty a great dream of theirs will be impossible, The duty is pointless or actively harmful to everyone but they see no way to avoid it

They have some person, institution, or situation in their life that is going to explode. Self-destructive choices, internal strife, impending doom, or some other trigger is going to send shrapnel through all their plans, and it’s only a matter of time before it detonates.

Conversely, they may be the bomb. They may be under unendurable pressure, prey to some madness, afflicted with a curse, or otherwise facing a situation that can only end with catastrophically bad results at some unknown but rapidly-approaching time.

A Defuse the bomb by resolving the situation that is causing it, Eliminate or distance the person or institution before it can blow up on them, Arrange the situation so an enemy or rival suffers the consequences of the blast

P The rising chaos is very profitable to them in wealth or granted influence, They have great influence over the bomb until it explodes, The bomb’s explosion would cause enormous damage to a rival or enemy

D The crisis suddenly comes to a peak much too soon, A twist leaves them even more vulnerable to the consequences of an explosion, One of their enemies or rivals is actively provoking the situation
