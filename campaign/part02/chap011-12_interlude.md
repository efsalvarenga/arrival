## Intro

- 

## Strong start

- You are all in a ship, navigating a starless and moonless night in a turbulent see.
- There are some light clouds in the sky.
- You are under the command of Kimbarak, a strong human sea captain, and you are in a "mission".
	- The ship top-rank crew consists of Kimbarak, first mate, quartermaster and a sailing master.
	- The crew of seafarers consists of 8 men, including the 3 PCs.
	- There is one cook and one carpenter.
- You see in distance a cyclopean island, which you know is what you've been looking for
- STR DC 6 to not fall from the ship because of the waves or docking

## Potential scenes

- *Intro* to investigation: Vorlak receives the PCs - he looks human, but something is wrong.
	- Vorlak is the community translator and he is **working on translating** a ritual from the **Forge Scriptorium Walls**
	- **PCs's mission is to execute the ritual**
	- Vorlak **needs help to find Kalrov**, who bears the Angelic Sword, required for the ritual 
- *Investigation* A: **What is the ritual about?**
	- Vorlak explains the ritual is to bind Mondedovil to a physical form, so he stops harming the Ngar'tho
- #attention **Share the first image of the Ngar'tho**
- *Investigation* B: **Where is the ritual taking place**
	- Vorlak does not know yet, but it is written in the **Forge Scriptorium Walls**
- *Investigation* C: Translating the name of the location of the ritual from the Forge Scriptorium Walls
	- Requires Kalrov, who **does not have the Angelic Sword** - **Kimbarak has it**
- #attention **Share the second image of the Ngar'tho**
- *Resolution*: The ritual is found to happen on the **Eldritch Furnace**
	- Kimbarak asks the PCs to **distract the Ngar'tho so that he can spoil** the ritual, in a suicidal bid
	- The ritual was not to bind or free Mondedovil, but to use **Kimbarak to create the race of the dwarves** - who will now deliver the plan.
	- **Kimbarak dissolves** into the theurgical tapestry
- *Escape*: **Like Call of Cthulhu** - but now without Kimbarak
	- Mondedonvil chases the PCs
	- Kimbarak is found on the ship days later, as the first dwarf.
