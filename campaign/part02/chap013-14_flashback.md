### Motivations

**Library topics (9)**
- **Kethra**
	- #k1 (addressed) Legends on purple dragons
- **Miraak**
	- #m1 (addressed) How to kill dragons
	- #m2 (addressed) How to turn an undead alive again
- **Guilf**
	- #g1 (addressed) Mr Void
	- #g2 (addressed) Algath's prison, temple of remains and relationship with dragons
- **Amyria**
	- #a1 (addressed) Bretzal paths and intensified earth energy in the Ammuinoth. Extra motivation is also to try and figure out why FFKA prohibited the investigation of this type of magic. 
	- #a2 (addressed) Ophaerie.The place below the Ghost domain. The red glowy place we came across. I am thinking it might be where the dragon got blessed from Algath. 
	- #a3 (addressed) Theotechnology from ancient times
- **Dolman**
	- #d1 (addressed) Golden dragon machines since he believes that some how this religion antagonize his motherâ€™s religion
- **Extra**
	- #e1 (addressed) Kimbarak

### PC dragon creation

**Cerulean powers (psionic + sorcery)**
- Corona of fury
- Wings (which word?)
- Power when close to death (name?)
- Something else?
- Turn into human, but no dragon-form power is available, turning takes 1 round

## Storyline

### Sorcerer-Kings Era, early Cerulean Cycle
***1.7 million years ago, Eldritch (necromancy) and Cerulean apex***

- PCs are young lesser-dragons. Lesser dragons are known as the unfinished, as their human ancestors were not able to finish their rituals to become greater-dragons. Even lesser are the dragonborn, which is a enslaved race treated as poorly as humans.
- The party is a reconnoissance and assault unit for the Dragon Imperator Yrroi, The Voiceless One. He communicates with psionic powers only. Their city state borders the Gok Akkad, empire ruled by the Sorcerer-King necromancer Algath.
- A powerful sorcerer from Yrroi's city state betrayed Yrroi and is now an ally of Algath. There are rumours she has now completed her transformation into a Lich. Yrroi demands that she is found, and brought back, so he can turn her back to life, to then give her the end she deserves. He is a god, after all - that is the only thing needed to bring someone back to life. #m2 , assault and rescue challenge.
	- Hopefully some combat with undead armies (revenants) is enough to kill one of the PCs #m1 
- Algath storms the city state with his army, he is now an **Unending one**. Tough fight that hopefully kills PCs. If some of them are not killed, they need to flee or hide.

### Sorcerer-Kings Era to Celestial Storm
***1.3 million years ago, Cerulean and Celestial apex, Eldritch demise***

- PCs are the same dragons, now more mature (1 level more).
- The world is dominated by the dragons now, with all other sentient races subjugated. Dragon Imperators rule from their city states. Yrroi is even more powerful, and his deep psionics are finishing re-building a jump gate high in the sky to claim the heavens, since earth is completely claimed.

**Hundreds of years passes**

- The construction is finished and the PCs are joining a counter offence force (social or military - they choose)
- There is a fight in heaven and both forces are greatly reduced
- PCs, as the counter offence force, need to prepare for a possible Angel invasion, which comes a few weeks later
- Supraxae comes from heaven, and kill the shit out of the dragons #d1 
- The city state is lost and left in crumbles
- Yrroi, almost dead, commands the PCs to trace the destroyed Supraxae and work with the psionics so that something is made to save him.
	- Theotechnology is created and the first Made God is born out of the Supraxae and Yrroi. The made god expels the Angels from the city state. #a3 


### Celestial Storm
***1.1 million years ago, Theotechnical and Eldrich apex, Celestial and Cerulean demise***

- The Angels chase and exterminate most of the dragon life on earth. The PCs survived hidden.
- Under the crumbles, and in dark places, sorcerers and hidden dragons (now at an uneasy peace) continue to construct Made Gods, to revenge. Thousands of them are built.
- One of them is Algath!
- They blast the heaven and destroy everything they touch, including the celestial engines. (PCs accompany them?)
- Angels are losing the war, and comet down to earth the invaders.
- PCs land on earth, but reality is now broken (everything crumbling like temple of remains) - celestial engines fail
- Dragons cannot mate and reproduce anymore
- The PCs are close to the Made God Algath, as he falls with hundreds of severely injured dragons with him to uncreation.
	- The PCs can follow if they want
	- Part of the uncreation is claimed by Algath, and he takes lair their with the injured dragons. They all become shadow versions of themselves, and the Ophaire is created. #a2 #k1 


### The Legacy
***900 thousand years ago***

- The angels (Edrahil) that took residence on Earth are looking for Algath, somehow they want the PCs to help find him.
- Algath has to be found and brought back to remainded of earth, which is severely uncreated now.
- Algath is imprisioned #g2 
- The world is now full of different populations, including proto-elves and several humanoid sub-species (no dwarves yet)
- PCs are approached by a proto-elf sorcerer that is trying to save reality. Destroyed Supraxae and Made Gods were recovered and in the last thousand years a portfolio of engines were re-created. They need to be scattered through the world to restablish reality. This is the Legacy. #a1
- (some mission to accomplish that) - The Legacy makes the Brezal paths

### Outsider Rulers
***200 thousand years ago, Psionic and Theotechnical apex, Eldritch, Cerulean demise***

- Aliens invade, and the 'tho loses their Hive Brain
- Somehow the PCs meet them, and they learn about the Made Gods
	- The 'tho uses Theotechnical devices to save the Hive Brain, which becomes The Void #g1 
- The legacy constantly challenge the more powerful 'tho - Legacy defense mechanism... only the lay low 'thos are able to survive
- Outsiders push all humanity to the deeps of earth
- Outsider new constructions look like the organic constructions of the modern Maqqatba
- The Void tries to execute control on the void, but cannot. Decides to create the dwarves out of Arratu muds. The dwarves are created but uncontrolled. They need a spirit to "guide them" - Kimbarak #e1
