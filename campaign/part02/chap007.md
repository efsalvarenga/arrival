## Intro

- Read aloud:
	- [Abridged for chapter 6](https://github.com/efsalvarenga/arrival_open/blob/main/context/abridged.md#chapter-6-the-torturer-of-holzander)
	- [Linhe](https://github.com/efsalvarenga/arrival_open/blob/main/context/realms.md#linhe)
	- [Rurkinar](https://github.com/efsalvarenga/arrival_open/blob/main/context/religions.md#rurkinar)
- Do you remember why your characters are here and not somewhere else?

## Strong start

A resting conversation with [Ushulx](../npcs/ushulx.md), Dugan, Red Hart, Ichbon about the current lore, touching subjects such as:

- [x] **Ushulx searching for Aivryndt**, who went to the Deadecho and was blessed by [Algath](../npcs/algath.md) herself
- [x] The Holzander catacombs are **rife with undead, thanks to a weak spot in the dimensional barrier** between here and the Deadecho
- [x] The Deadecho, the dominion of [Algath](../context/religions.md#Algath) (and the equally notorious Vardesain and Anu-Akma, fellow demigods of the dead), is notable for its silence - an existence of enormous deserts of bones, dunes of dust, and rivers of blood and tears. These are the dry lands, where life extends past its appointed span, where fate itself is thwarted with regularity, and where liches, vampires, and ghouls gather in enormous numbers to praise their patron and the font of vileness, to cheat death, to praise their protection against a certain voyage into the hells and the joy and strength of the god of the undead and his near-infinite legions.
- [ ] Closing the portal requires more than just traditional magic or arcane manipulation. A darkness deep below the Scarlet Citadel is responsible for the open wound leading to the Dry Lands.
- [x] Location of Mystra's door in the castle
- [x] Ichbon researching the Lady Scurvy: a mix of undeath and lycanthropy
- [ ] Traders mentioning the desert is getting colder and even more bare
- [x] Torture of Gaelira (including screaming the name "Angel Hound"), which stoped and she was sent downstairs. She was not killed by the Gaoler
- [x] Other conversation points from Ushulx below:

## Potential scenes

#### 207 (CR 4)

The green ink is actually an ink guardian ooze (Creature Codex). Its instructions donâ€™t include stopping people from leafing casually through the notebook. It attacks if anyone damages anything in the room, alters the notebook in any way, or pockets something from the desk.

#### 209

If creature touches the time tributary allow a Constitution saving through DC 15. Regardless of the result, effect of 5 of lower happens and character falls **inconscient** (they have time to undevelop their character back to level 1). The other result would be age until death. Make sure to make second character touching it in line with the first result.

#### 213

## Information Pool

**Factions (1 to 3)**
- [x] Lady Scurvy linked with a specific type of death lycanthropy that have arrived in the region of Katho about an year ago - source of death lycanthropy in old ages to the south east
- [ ] FFKA very little knowledge about the castle - and just a bunch of religious bullies
- [ ] A fire demon knight is the messenger between Gellert and the high septon of Mondendovil, the Forefather

**Context (1 to 3)**
- [x] **Major secret (i.e. gold dragons, undead horde, etc.) exists in an ancient elven library in the Holzander**
- [x] Avrindyt, the Creep, the red dragon who a legend say was blessed into a deep death dragon by Algath herself
- [ ] Music about the Glasrath heroes that saved the mountains and then died in the tunnels.
- [x] The monuments, tombs, and pyramids of past golden ages litter Linhe. These countless tombs are interconnected, forming a vast, semi-hidden underground network through the Ammuinoth and the Ghost Domain.
- [x] Linhe is a land of vast deserts and rare, but deadly, storms.

**Advancing arcs (2 to 4)**
- [x] Cagoth-ze and Danaska Maksilov's works in the second level

**Rumours (2)**
