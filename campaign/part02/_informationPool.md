## Highlights

- [ ] Serhan (guard captain of Glasrath) went into one of the Mercian houses in Linhe
- [ ] Mercians from the east are reaching out to Glasrath to establish trading routes with them as well - great produce is coming from the mountains who have their strong community now behind the banner of Ghuse.

## Holzander Castle

- [ ] #puzzle **Danaska made a calming potion for the trollkin to take Gaelira somewhere (to Raganni for a Lich ritual)**
- [ ] #strategic Danaska and Cagoth-ze are at odds as danaska thinks it is cagoth-ze's fault that her documents were vanished
- [ ] #spoiler Location of the Ancient Elven Library: in a secret cavern in the Ammuinoth, where now is the Holzander castle.
- [ ] #strategic One who possesses Cagoth-ze’s ring and the instructions for recalibrating the time construct can set it randomly so it will almost never return back here again.
- [ ] #strategic Cagoth-ze had Imortra build a summoning circle and summon Lasbascilag (the Lesser Infernal Tutor). Immorta wants nothing to do with the devil (she knows how dangerous it is). Cagoth thinks he can control the devil to get valuable information.
- [ ] #strategic The furnace in area 206 (pg 54) is drawing tremendous arcane power beyond any one wizard’s ability to control. The source of this power lies deeper in the castle. The draw of power to this furnace is keeping this power tethered and strained. It’s like a knot in a tangle of ropes.
- [ ] #spoiler Closing the portal requires more than just traditional magic or arcane manipulation. A darkness deep below the Scarlet Citadel is responsible for the open wound leading to the Dry Lands.
- [ ] #spoiler Cagoth-ze is a powerful wizard but completely obsessed with acquiring knowledge of the elves who used to be here. The elves managed to hide their lore not in a place, but in a time, and that steered Cagoth-ze into the twisted practice of Time Magic. It’s amazing he hasn’t torn himself into pieces spread over thousands of years practicing this type of heretical magic.
- [ ] #spoiler  Cagoth-ze has constructs traveling into the future to recover elven tomes hidden away in the future. They bring them back and attempt to copy them before those tomes disappear back to the future. It takes many runs on the same book to make a full copy. It’ll take years to get the whole library copied.
- [ ] #puzzle Exit of Mystra's door is in the Dannamore Hold ruins
- [ ] #puzzle The multiple nodes tying these lines of power together. Each must be disabled to release the tension of the lines.
- [ ] #spoiler Level 3 used to be the dwarven barracks of the dwarves who built the Scarlet Citadel but is now overrun with trollkin.
- [ ] #spoiler Level 4 are the unconstructed caverns of the Ghost Domain, now territory of a bat cult - where a dark river flows.
- [ ] #spoiler There are twenty five trollkin, eight anak hounds, and four dire flying anaks in the Dwarven Ruins.
- [ ] Where is Galiera: she was sent as a present for the completion of the ritual that will make Reganni a Lich. The ritual is already completed, and she is dead and buried in the desert. (She is actually a vampire now, if someone rescues her body and is dirty with blood she will wake up). Gellert wants to use the tower to channel the energy umbilical he will create later.
- [ ] Something about Gellert and Imortra and the Mercians
- [ ] The works in the Holzander castle is making the desert even more bare
- [ ] destroy the Theotechnical engines that are pulling the brezal paths as strings and rifting reality

## Linhe

- [ ] Sandman warriors: champions of the Angels

## General

- [ ] **Foucheresia is joining Katho in the war, and sending the Thymar host south**
- [ ] #spoiler Frost anaks come from D'Elsin and the non-evil have been pushed north by the forces of Turnskull advancing
- [ ] #context Age of dragon imperators in the past, now they are imprisioned in the Master's Teeth mountains, in the isle of Atba Sim.
- [ ] #context **Stone from Gaelira in a book of Geology of Maqqatba: Chronoliths**.
- [ ] #context Olivepia is where the head of the Faletist church sits. It is a religious empire with a strong hand on neighbour empires (other empires are vassals)
- [ ] #strategic **Glasrath: number of undead greatly surpasses the number of alive people (2-to-1), mostly working the mines. Singlestrike joins support for Ghuse and population is mostly in full support (about 200 soldiers and guards are supporting). If characters haven't noticed yet, they notice now, that people are looking more pale and seem a bit brain drained.**
- [ ] Dwarves have a subconscious connection with the weaving of the world

## Ancient Elven Library

- [ ] #spoiler Gold Dragons looks similar to Iopothae's constructs run by Seraphic Engines
- [ ] #spoiler Illithids were the ancient creatures that enslaved the Duergar and the Drow when they reached the depths of the Ghost Domain. They have been running experiments for millennia.
- [ ] #spoiler Great confluence and pooling of energy is all but unique in the Castle of Holzander
- [ ] #spoiler Partial map of the Ghost Domain
- [ ] #context Perhaps no region inspires more tales of terror across the face of Guermenos than the ruined desert. A once-verdant land permanently ravaged by the Great War. A puckered, ragged scar of desiccated land.
- [ ] #context [The great purge](../context/secrets/secretsHistory.md#The%20great%20purge)
- [ ] #context For centuries, tyrannical arcanists dueled over the Brezal Paths. Tremendously powerful creatures built and abandoned principalities as the fickle Paths shifted, and the constant magical strife among the rivals drained the life from the land. Only the bones of these cities remain today, their tumbled stones and spires covering a landscape.
- [ ] #context When the elves realized the enormity of what this library represented, they cast an enchantment over the place to protect it. Their enchantment threw the library and its contents 100,000 years into the future. That distant age is far beyond the collapse of all predicted civilizations. The elves reasoned that even if the library were discovered to exist in that time, it’s unlikely anyone of that era could understand its contents; according to elven oracles, whatever creatures inhabit Midgard 100,000 years in the future will have a completely different understanding of the fundamental underpinnings of magical philosophy.
- [ ] #context #spoiler Theurgy and Theotechnical mechanics
- [ ] The great purge poem
