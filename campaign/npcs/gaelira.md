She is a daughter of a drow and a Nargun dwarf, and has been a respected warrior in the region. Around 20 years ago she decided to go with the Paragon Force to the Ammuinoth and below, to investigate reports of a large evil host moving north. Whursock never saw her again, but also did not hear anything of her being defeated. And she is pretty tough to be defeated.

Dolman asked Whursock if he had even seen a stone Dolman carry as an amulet (because he mentioned he is friends of Dolman's father) He answers that indeed he has seen it. It was a stone the mighty Gaelira Beikaer (the drow/dwarf female warrior) carried for luck when he met her (while she travelled together with Dolman's father). This was roughly 40 years ago. Gaelira still has the amulet, missing the stone now.
