***Cultist of Curcharn***

## Background

-   Ushulx aids the Gaoler just enough to keep him from turning against her. In exchange, he hands his victims over to her when they are on death’s door so she can sacrifice their last whispers of life to Curcharn.
-   Ushulx helping the characters doesn’t mean she’s had a change of heart about her evil ways. She sees the Gaoler and Scar as liabilities. In exchange for her help, Ushulx wants to be left alone.
-   In the end, Ushulx wants the characters dead, and she’s certain they’ll be killed if they proceed to deeper levels. Helping them head down to the arcane scriptorium or into the crypts is her way of sending them to their deaths. If the characters are disrespectful or try to bully her, Ushulx warns Cagoth-ze that intruders are on the way (assuming she isn’t killed in the crypts).

After meeting the characters Ushulx now likes them, as she thinks they are necromancers.
