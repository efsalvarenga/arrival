# Cagoth-ze

The lower ranking of Gellert the Gruesome’s two lieutenants is the gnome wizard Cagoth-ze. He left his ancestral home in Neimheim decades ago after a long-running squabble with his brother turned deadly over a birthright. Fratricide isn’t that shocking in the Nine Cities, but Cagoth-ze was the unpopular one of the two siblings. His brother’s allies would have killed him (or worse), so he departed for safer territory. In light of his fascination with ley lines, conjurations, and time manipulation, he couldn’t have landed in a better spot than the ancient scriptorium of the elves beneath the Scarlet Citadel. The gnome bemusedly considers murdering his brother to be the best thing he ever did.

Cagoth-ze uses the standard stat block for an NPC mage but with an altered spell list. Spells with an asterisk are from the Kobold Press book Deep Magic. Their descriptions are included in the section Deep Magic Spells for reference.

The gnome carries a small ring of keys to unlock the doors in Areas 210, 215, and 217. He also wears a simple gold stickpin in his waistcoat that allows him to open and close those doors as if they’re unlocked without using   the keys. This item can be a lifesaver if he finds himself running from an enemy through hallways and chambers. It works only on those three locks.

Cagoth-ze also wears the ring of being anchored in time, which renders him immune to the risks of the time tributary. This gives him an excellent ploy, if he can entice intruders to chase him through the raw time stream.

## FORETELL DISTRACTION
1st-level divination

Casting Time: 1 bonus action Range: Self  
Components: S  
Duration: Instantaneous

Thanks to your foreknowledge, you know exactly when your foe will take his or her eyes off you. Casting this spell has the same effect as making a successful Dexterity (Stealth) check, provided cover or concealment is available within 10 feet of you. It doesn’t matter whether enemies can see you when you cast the spell; they glance away at just the right moment. You can move up to 10 feet as part of casting the spell, provided you’re able to move (not restrained or grappled or reduced to a speed of less than 10 feet for any other reason). This move doesn’t count as part of your normal movement. After the spell

is cast, you must be in a position where you can remain hidden: a lightly obscured space, for example, or a space where you have total cover. Otherwise, enemies see you again immediately and you’re not hidden.

## TIME STEP
2nd-level conjuration

Casting Time: 1 action Range: Self Components: V Duration: Instantaneous

You briefly step forward in time. You disappear from your location and reappear at the start of your next turn in a location of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the space you disappeared from. You can’t be affected by anything that happens during the time you’re missing, and you aren’t aware of anything that happens during that time.

## TIME VORTEX
4th-level evocation

Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: 90 feet  
Components: V, S, M  
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell destabilizes the flow of time, enabling you to create a vortex of temporal fluctuations that are visible as a spherical distortion with a 10-foot radius, centered on a point within range. Each creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw  
or be affected by the time vortex. While the spell lasts, a creature that enters the sphere or starts its turn inside the sphere must also succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected. On a successful save, it becomes immune to this casting of the spell.

An affected creature can’t take reactions and rolls a d10 at the start of its turn to determine its behavior for that turn.

## WALL OF TIME
5th-level abjuration (temporal)

Casting Time: 1 action  
Range: 120 feet  
Components: V, S, M (an hourglass) Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of shimmering, transparent blocks on a solid surface within range. You can make a straight wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a cylindrical wall up to 20 feet high, 1 foot thick, and 20 feet in diameter. Nonmagical ranged attacks that cross the wall vanish into the time stream with no other effect.

Ranged spell attacks and ranged weapon attacks made with magic weapons that pass through the wall are made with disadvantage. A creature that intentionally enters or passes through the wall is affected as if it had just failed its initial saving throw against a slow spell.
