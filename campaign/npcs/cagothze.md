# Cagoth-ze

![|500](https://i.imgur.com/XWEnZZC.png)

The lower ranking of Gellert the Gruesome’s two lieutenants is the gnome wizard Cagoth-ze. He left his ancestral home in Neimheim decades ago after a long-running squabble with his brother turned deadly over a birthright. Fratricide isn’t that shocking in the Nine Cities, but Cagoth-ze was the unpopular one of the two siblings. His brother’s allies would have killed him (or worse), so he departed for safer territory. In light of his fascination with ley lines, conjurations, and time manipulation, he couldn’t have landed in a better spot than the ancient scriptorium of the elves beneath the Scarlet Citadel. The gnome bemusedly considers murdering his brother to be the best thing he ever did.

The gnome carries a small ring of keys to unlock the doors in Areas 210, 215, and 217. He also wears a simple gold stickpin in his waistcoat that allows him to open and close those doors as if they’re unlocked without using   the keys. This item can be a lifesaver if he finds himself running from an enemy through hallways and chambers. It works only on those three locks.

Cagoth-ze also wears the ring of being anchored in time, which renders him immune to the risks of the time tributary. This gives him an excellent ploy, if he can entice intruders to chase him through the raw time stream.
