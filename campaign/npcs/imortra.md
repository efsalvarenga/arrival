## Background

Imortra the Debased is an elf wizard who’s fanatically devoted to Gellert the Gruesome. She heard tales about the unique magical properties of the Scarlet Citadel region from elves who saw those properties firsthand centuries ago, before the Holzanger family laid any claim over the area. Those tales drew Imortra to the citadel to study, and Gellert was already there. Their peculiar interests overlapped, and because Gellert was far ahead of Imortra in knowledge and understanding, he became the master and she the student. But they are also collaborators.

Imortra’s name originated during the years of her early adulthood, when her research and experiments in conjuring elementals and devils resulted in repeated tragedies. Traditional elements of her elven community considered such things to be “dark arts,” and they condemned her for tapping into evils she didn’t understand and couldn’t control. When her conjurations resulted in innocent deaths, Imortra was banned from the elven community for two centuries.
