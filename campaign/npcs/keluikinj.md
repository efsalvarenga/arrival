# Keluikinj

The leader (firstblade) of the dust goblin raiding party is a veteran of many such incursions named Keluikinj. Like most dust goblins who rise to positions of leadership  in their tribe, Keluikinj’s mind is twisted and grim. He’s no more sadistic than most dust goblins, but he has a fascination with the Void—or at least with the idea of the Void, as his understanding of the Void’s nature is only a caricature of reality. Based on what he’s seen inside the citadel, Keluikinj believes Cagoth-ze and Danaska Maksilov have a connection to the Void that he’d like to exploit. They don’t, but that belief is what’s stopped the dust goblins so far from finishing what they came here for, which is murder and looting. The other dust goblins in Keluikinj’s group are losing patience with his delays and are on the verge of killing him so they can get on with killing everyone else.
