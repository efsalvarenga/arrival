Shape of Drow:
- Female Drow Monk
- Reddish skin a drow, with silver hair with dark red brushes and black eyes.
- She is astonishingly beautiful with blood red skin, with dark red hair and black eyes
- She wears simple clothing and wields a mace
- Compulsively mutters taunts and mockery, and for that she is distrusted by most of other city leaders

Theklurth  was really sad when Wyvern died, as if she has lost a family member or someone very close to her. None of you knew (or saw anything unusual) that would suggest they were so close.

When she was asked about it she said she does not know why she felt like this. She is currently MIA
