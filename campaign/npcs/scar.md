Scar is a tusked crimson ogre (Creature Codex). A healthy tusked crimson ogre’s challenge rating is 5. Because ofthe Gaoler’s constant abuse, Scar has only 50 hit points, its Berserker’s Blood ability does half damage (10 - 3d6), and a berserk creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. These changes reduce Scar to challenge rating 3 (700 XP).
