Scar is a tusked crimson ogre (Creature Codex). A healthy tusked crimson ogre’s challenge rating is 5. Because ofthe Gaoler’s constant abuse, Scar has only 50 hit points, its Berserker’s Blood ability does half damage (10 - 3d6), and a berserk creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. These changes reduce Scar to challenge rating 3 (700 XP).

Blood Frenzy. 

The ogre has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hp.

Rampage. 

When the ogre reduces a creature to 0 hp with a melee attack on its turn, the ogre can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make one bite attack.

#### Actions

Multiattack. 

The tusked crimson ogre makes two attacks: one with its morningstar and one with its bite.

Morningstar. 

Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.

Bite. 

Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

Berserker's Blood (Recharge 5-6). 

If the tusked crimson ogre doesn't have all of its hp, it flexes and roars, spraying blood from its wounds. Each creature within 15 feet of the ogre must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 [3d6] acid damage and goes berserk. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and doesn't go berserk. On each of its turns, a berserk creature must attack the nearest creature it can see, eschewing ranged or magical attacks in favour of melee attacks. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the berserk creature attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. A berserk creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success**
