# Sergarus

Sergarus, the [FFKA East](../factions/ffkaEast.md) commander, has stood at the edge of the battlefield in the south, his armour blackened with ash and stained with the blood of his enemies. His blade glinted in the moonlight as he surveyed the carnage before him, his eyes ablaze with a fiery zealotry. For years, he had served the Faletist Church, hunting down heretics and rooting out sin wherever he found it. But now, as he gazed upon the horrors of war, he could not help but feel a sense of doubt creeping into his mind. Had he been fighting the wrong battle all along?

He had seen first-hand the atrocities committed by those who had turned away from the faith, and he could not allow such evil to go unchecked. But as he looked upon the twisted corpses of those he had slain, he began to question whether his actions were truly righteous. Despite his doubts, Sergarus remained steadfast in his convictions. He knew that he must continue to fight, even if it meant sacrificing his own soul in the process. For he believed that the Church was the only hope for salvation in a world consumed by darkness and chaos. And so he would carry on, his heart heavy with the weight of his sins, but his faith burning brighter than ever.

Sergarus does not have a base in the FFKA East region of influence, prefering to travel often between posts.
