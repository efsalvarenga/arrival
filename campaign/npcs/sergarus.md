# Sergarus Drakov

Sergarus, the [FFKA East](../factions/ffkaEast.md) commander, has stood at the edge of the battlefield in the south, his armour blackened with ash and stained with the blood of his enemies. His blade glinted in the moonlight as he surveyed the carnage before him, his eyes ablaze with a fiery zealotry. He and his troops executed a thousand ancient grudges and atrocities. Infamous but respected, Drakov amassed a fortune and planned to retire young, buying a title and a realm to rule.

After a while, as he gazed upon the horrors of war, he could not help but feel a sense of doubt creeping into his mind. Had he been fighting the wrong battle all along? He then decided to serve the Faletist Church in the north, and has been hunting down heretics and rooting out sin wherever he found it for years.

He had seen first-hand the atrocities committed by those who had turned away from the faith, and he could not allow such evil to go unchecked. But as he looked upon the twisted corpses of those he had slain, he began to question whether his actions were truly righteous. Despite his doubts, Sergarus remained steadfast in his convictions. He knew that he must continue to fight, even if it meant sacrificing his own soul in the process. For he believed that the Church was the only hope for salvation in a world consumed by darkness and chaos. And so he would carry on, his heart heavy with the weight of his sins, but his faith burning brighter than ever.

A few years ago, the First Siege of the city of Linhe raged for four days. Drakov's strategies, both brilliant and desperate, eventually turned back the zombie horde, but at the cost of most of his veteran troops. Since then, Drakov has lost nearly his entire nation. Every month a new desperate battle unfolds. He prepares ceaselessly for each, certain of her plans and ultimate victory, but doubting the mettle of her troops. With threats and public, impalings he tries to keep her people more terrified of her than of the undead. And with every new moon she faces an unconquerable foe, never revealing to anyone that each zombie bears the familiar, rotting face of an innocent her soldiers once put to the sword.

Sergarus Drakov is an experienced military commander with statistics similar to those of a **knight**. While his martial skill is considerable, her true might comes in the form of the obedient army that unquestioningly enacts her every whim. Sergarus does not have a base in the FFKA East region of influence, preferring to travel often between posts.
