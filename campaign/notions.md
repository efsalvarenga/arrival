## Background & lore

### Secrets
- Shield of beauty is the vampire spreading the Lady Scurvy
	- Galiera and the paragon force were captured by the gaoler, everyone was tortured and killed, but Galiera was spared and sent to Gellert as a present. The Gaoler would tell he killed everyone, including her - or that he maybe handled her over to Gellert? Or to Cagoth Ze
	- Gellert later on decided to hand Galiera over to the Mercian leaders.
	- At some point Galiera was killed, but brought back by the evil gods as a vampire - with the spawn curse with her
	- Galiera took lair in the north, where she has been spreading the spawn curse - and only figure this out much later.
- Sulpraxae are either controlled by an Ancient gold dragon (all controlled by one dragon) or have a gold dragon within each Supraxais (singular of Sulpraxae)
- Cold desert was created by a planar warp/magic gone awry in the old days 
- Duergar and Drows were enslaved when they went too deep

### Rumours
- Agents of Silk have captured Daardendrien Turan, the Nurderad clan elder and replaced him with a doppelganger
- Random rumours [hundredsRumours](resources/hundredsRumours.md)


## Arcs & hooks

### Scenes
- Tales of the Glasrath battle sang by bards 

### Snoozed hooks
- In 3877.65 NC the Lady Scurvy spreads to another region
- In 3878.4 NC Theklurth will come back for a revenge on the party (and Miraak)
- Aivridyt's eggs hatch in the Darklake
- 3882 NC Sulpraxae scorching ends
- In 3894 NC Theklurth's child (demon dragonborn) will revenge it's mother
- 3902 NC Acrisae finish building fortresses
- Lady Scurvy was created by the Shield of Beauty Vampire that took residence in a castle close to Throtha, and it is spreading. It is a vampirism disease that strongly affects all races from the Nulfith culture (elves and half-elves) `ST with disadvantage`, weekly affects all other non-human races `ST normal` and rarely affects humans `ST with advantage`

### Chapters
- Celebration that is censored by FFKA
- Montagem de uma viagem longa, including desert beast tracking the characters
- Competing groups trying to retrieve something from somewhere
- When will the dragonborn come in the story?
- Next dungeon: look at dungeon hazards dmg105 and rules DMG290
- Later faction: knights of the restless (https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L8JrLtObw8AvcFw4JcW)
- Look at adventures bought on bd&d
- PCs hunt (Tom&Jerry) their own dark characters


### Long arcs

### Themes (??)
- Dark fantasy / horror / evil empire of the dead in the south and all areas with Lady Scurvy
- Intrigue / sabotage in Olivepia and the West continent: any human empires playing political games as opposed to fighting on the troubled area
- The insatiable thirst for control by the good and evil children of the gods. With touches of troubled heroes (rage and fury that lies in their own hearts) - how to implement that?
- Collect artefacts that together have great power
- PCs get drawn into the darkness
	- Miraak: Undead - gets Relentless Endurance (1/Day). When reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, he can drop to 1 hit point instead. However he should be treated as undead for any rule reason.
	- Dolman: Vampire
	- Someone else: Lycantropy

### Future parts
- Fallout / Last of Us style in North Katho
- While Acrisae sets up - cold war style of factions: Rules Factions
- Reclaim wars (after the Acrisae are set up), Acrisae win over the south. Then peace. (4300 NC)
- Arkulians arrive from Hincland and they expand and set up. (5000 NC)
- Arkul's war campaign. Acrisae loose? (5200 NC)
- A new beginning to win Arkulians - find Turnskull to destroy the evil God power. Finally peace forever? (5300 NC)
- Then the call of cthulhu?

## Entities

### Locations

- Japan / China inspired area in the world
- Angkor wat
- South Kathan empire is very underdeveloped
	- South desert is full of canyons and mountains
