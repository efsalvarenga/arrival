The only city left in the Linhe region, Linhe now bears the brunt of the zombie invasion. The old city outgrew its walls multiple times since its founding, leaving its districts divided by fortifications. During the First Siege of Linhe, General Drakov sacrificed the entirety of the southern Blivia's Gate, leaving hundreds of souls to be slaughtered but allowing the remaining defenders to turn back the zombie horde.

The city's survivors face harsh conditions. FFKA soldiers patrol the walls and the streets, keeping peace in the cramped slums that now fill the city. Troops lead civilians outside the walls to scavenge from ruined settlements and work the fields of abandoned farms, but their harvests are never enough for the city's survivors. Though bitter and desperate, soldiers live marginally better than civilians, being assured of daily rations and housing in the Bastion Ward—the FFKA-only district around city hall where General Drakov established her command centre. From here, Sergarus orders daily public executions as conscripts dispense supplies to the masses, and she plans how to resist the next zombie attack.
