# Dannamore Hold
***Where Mystra's door's tunnel get in the desert***

- Locals think the ground is a taboo
- A plague or curse made it uninhabitable
- Everyone thinks it has already been looted
- Belonging to the unfathomable past
- Part of a close-by ruined city
- Overly optimistic settlers tried to reclaim it
- Used to be a prison



The natives of the ruin have a secret deal or arrangement with some outside power, doing their bidding or providing some special service in exchange for considerations. It might be a corrupt ruler, a sinister cult, an Outsider lord, a backwater hamlet chief, or some other figure that wouldn’t wish the arrangement to become public.

E  Merchant with vile black market deals, Official who wants the ruin to remain a problem, Society grandee with sinister appetites 
6.  F  Suspicious noble investigator, Stern inquisitor from the local temple, Local who knows too much
    

C The deal is maintaining a fragile peace, There’s an openly-acknowledged deal with them but the real bargain is far more sinister, One side is getting ready to betray the other

T Proof of the alliance, Rich plunder taken from an ally’s enemy, Relic the mutual cooperation is meant to obtain

P Secret meeting place in the wilds, Chamber for an envoy of the ally, Treasure chamber with goods from the ally
