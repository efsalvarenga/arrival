Cyclical Doom

There’s a phenomenon to the ruin that makes it tremendously dangerous at certain intervals. Fluxes of ancient radiation, swarms of quick-breeding dangerous vermin, withering geomantic conjunctions, or cyclically-awakened preserved inhabitants might make the place exceedingly deadly for intruders there at that time. The natives may or may not know about the cycle, and if it’s a very long one, they might not have been around to see it happen.

5. E  Outsider determined to trigger the cycle, Native leader who wants to weaponize it, Outside researcher with no care for the consequences
    
6. F  Native aware of the impending disaster, Researcher trying to stop the cycle, Survivor of the last cycle
    

C The cycle leaves behind a valuable byproduct, The cycle only threatens certain occupants, Outsiders have totally misinterpreted the cycle’s meaning or events

T Key to trigger or halt the cycle, Device to protect users from the cycle, Object for controlling and directing the cycle

P Place scarred by a past cycle’s effects, Control or observation center, Monument obscurely referencing the cycle




Sealed Evil

The ruin serves as a prison for some terribly dangerous entity or power. It may have been originally designed to serve such a purpose, or retrofitted by later inhabitants due to a sudden need, or possibly even mistaken for some other kind of structure by innocent discoverers of a later era. Something about the evil makes it exceptionally hard to kill or permanently destroy, so imprisoning it “forever” seemed wiser.

E Undead immortal sorcerer, Monstrous and nigh- unkillable creature, Arch-Outsider with a biology humans can’t be sure is dead

F Hereditary warden of the prison, Innocently eager explorer, Ancestral hunter of the evil

C The evil was actually a benign entity or is currently mistaken for one, Those who loose it will gain enormous power, It’s being tapped for power in a way that risks freeing it

T Relic of the dark power’s evil, Seal on the creature that’s an extremely valuable item in itself, Valuable material created or generated by the prison as a byproduct

P Exceedingly well-sealed prison area, Chamber with a temporal stasis cell, Hall full of warning iconography made inscrutable by time
