# Dwarf Enclave of Durnum
***Dwarf enclave: Fallen prosperity & Broken spirits***

Ancient construction access for the Ammuinoth, which is not connected to the tunnels directly, but through the Ghost Domain. Small community (50 dwarves originally, reduced to 15) currently live in the area. They used to produce simple metals, that were traded with the dust elves. The undead hordes have raided them in the last months and they are in a state of despair and dull apathy.

Secret: **Dwarves have a subcouncious connection with the Legacy**

- E: Dust elves caravans are squeezing the last produce they can get, and community is under pressure to produce.
- F: Young leader wants to the community to move to deeper regions, with less mineral resources, but more protected.
- C: No alternative can get them to their original wealth position, unless the undead stop coming
- T: Whoever represents Kimbarak can help them regain self worth
- P: Crumbling mines
