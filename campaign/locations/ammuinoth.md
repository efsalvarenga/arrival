# The Ammuinoth

## History

The Ammuinoth was built as a series of underground tunnels following what is known as the Brezal Paths. These paths are believed to carry intensified earth energy. In these tunnels, castles, shrines and temples were built, as presents to the old gods. Now, thousands of years later, some of these temples are in ruins and some of the tunnels have also collapsed. On the map below, in red are Brezal Paths that are followed by roads in the surface; in blue are collapsed or partially collapsed tunnels and in black are tunnels in work order. Some researchers believe the energy paths are not real, and that the construction, in a leaf shape, was in deference to the old nature gods.

Nowadays, even the better tunnels have several fractures, from where the Ghost Domain can be accessed. In every large construction in the Ammuinoth, access to the surface and the ghost domain were built - but some of them are now lost.

###  Dwellers of the Ammuinoth

- Due to the access from the surface to the Ammuinoth: gangs of bandits and other scourge take lair and hide in the tunnels, in general everyone who wants to hide from society can be found there.
- Due to the frequent connects with the Ghost Domain: most of the creatures from the ghost domain can be found here including fiends, undead, drows, duegar, even beholders!

## Version from Whursock Greybow (Nargun)

> The kingdom of Iopothae was a very advanced kingdom from ancient times. It is said it covered a larger region than the current Khathan Empire. An alliance between immortal elves and dwarves created the Ammuinoth, a subterranean superstructure that traversed the kingdom (SW to NE) with a multitude of religious temples and shrines as a present to the gods people from Iopothae worshiped. The Ammuinoth was built below the surface. The Ghost Domain (below the Ammuinoth) wan unknown to all peoples at that time. The construction of Ammuinoth was also responsible for shaping the races of the drow (dark elves) and the duergar (dark dwarves), as they ventured deeper and deeper over centuries. It was during this project that the surface races found the Ghost Domain (known as Underdark to the Drows), where the Dows later on moved into.

## Version from Amyria's research

> One of the features of the the old kingdoms was the creation of the Ammuinoth (starting around year 1000 of the old calendar), a subterranean superstructure that traversed the continent (SW to NE) with a multitude of religious temples and shrines as a present to the gods. The Ammuinoth was built by an alliance of immortal elves and dwarves for over a thousand years.

> The construction of Ammuinoth was also responsible for shaping the races of the drow (dark elves) and the duergar (dark dwarves), as they ventured deeper and deeper over centuries. It is believed that the drow and duergar came into contact with some subterranean evil power, and were corrupted by it. But the corruption went unnoticed, until it was too late. It is not known when exactly, but somewhere around 3000 of the old calendar the drow came across a god-built cavern system below the Ammuinoth. This was named the Ghost Domain (or the Underdark by the modern drow). The duergar did not venture often to the Ghost Domain, as it was too primitive for them.
