# The Ammuinoth

The Ammuinoth was built as a series of underground tunnels following what is known as the Brezal Paths. These paths are believed to carry intensified earth energy. In these tunnels, castles, shrines and temples were built, as presents to the old gods. Now, thousands of years later, some of these temples are in ruins and some of the tunnels have also collapsed. On the map below, in red are Brezal Paths that are followed by roads in the surface; in blue are collapsed or partially collapsed tunnels and in black are tunnels in work order. Some researchers believe the energy paths are not real, and that the construction, in a leaf shape, was in deference to the old nature gods.

Nowadays, even the better tunnels have several fractures, from where the Ghost Domain can be accessed. In every large construction in the Ammuinoth, access to the surface and the ghost domain were built - but some of them are now lost.
