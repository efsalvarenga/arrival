# Castle of Holzander

Around 3627 NC, the young Gerhardt Holzanger discovered a rich Brezal Path tributary in the region, connecting to the Romburghia Road to the east and to the Darklake rivers to the west. This Brezal Path itself seemed to pool and gather strength deeper into the earth, which took the researcher to the Citadel built in the Ammuinoth tunnel. The isolation of the area was a good place for experiments that often involved chanting, arcane lights, and the strange smells of alchemical enhancements and distillations. It is told he bound himself to the ley line, giving himself and his children greater strength in using its magic. Over generations, the family interests delved deep into newts and amphibians, and then they became obsessed with horology, celestial mechanics, flotation and levitation, night creatures, angelic languages, and on and on, always seeking knowledge purely to possess it.

Probably 100 years later, duegar from the Ammuinoth took a keen interest in House Holzanger. These duegar agreed with Gerhardt III to protect the Citadel and, suddenly, there was a company of one hundred duegar and a half-dozen ring mages in the region. The duegar chased down and tamed owlbears from the steppes as hunting animals and guardians, and brought them to the Ammuinoth. With an even tighter collaboration between the Holzanger and the Duegar, the Citadel was expanded into a large castle and a vast subterranean dungeon. However, 40 years later, it is told the Faithful Faletist Knights of the Arch burnt the castle down under the Faletist Law of Magic, which prohibited earth magic investigation in the empire. The reality is that the castle was burnt and cleared by the Acrisae scouts, which were known in the region as the gold paladins. The FFKA claimed the action as none had claimed it, and it seemed like good propaganda for the growth of the church. Gerhardt IV was killed and his children disappeared.

Over the next 100 years, foul creatures have arrived and departed from the ruins and dungeons of the Burnt Castle of Holzander. These included cultists of Cuncharn (a minor deity under Algath), drows, demons and bandits alike. Void magic was developed within the walls of the castle and its dungeons, and often fractures to the obscure Ophaire were open. It is told a missing child of Gerhardt IV, Gerhardt the Changeling, came back to the castle with his son, Gellert the Gruesome, in company of the powerful arcane researchers Cagoth-ze and Imortra the Debased.
