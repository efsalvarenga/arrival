# Hermits' Crevasse
***Extreme example of native terrain: Collapsed deep & Hermitage***

An ancient Deep once was located here, but time caused it to collapse. The location is now a large crater, with the remnants of the deep's entrance. Small sections of the deep can still be accessed, but it is a major collapse risk. A Rurkinar hermit group lives in the safest area of the crumbling ruin, but now afraid of the undead.

- E Disguised Mercian living amongst the hermits
- F A funny blighted elf (calls himself Thirteen), that knows how to go around the ruins. He is seeking help for the hermits
- C Undead are digging their way up
- T Thirteen knows of a seraphic engine shard buried in the deep
- P Crevasse
