# Khathan Empire

## South Kathan Empire

The Khatan Empire, specially south of the Naragzah mountains, is hardly technologically developed. The Kuzar province has a technology maturity of 420, while the Tolfoddund province (not the mines) has a similar development, when excluding the dwarven technology. Slightly more advanced is the Kostoch province, with a maturity of 470.

### Political perspective

The strong dashed borders are kingdoms/state borders, while the minor borders (where you see different colours applied) are region borders. You are aware of an ongoing war between the Khathan Empire and D'elsin - southwest in the map - in blue.

### Cultures

From a cultural point of view, most peoples in the region are of the Nulfirth culture, which is nomadic and/or rural in nature. Very few cities lie in the desert, but some small cities are found in the coastal areas. Most of the Nulfirth people are humans, with some half-elfs. There are also dwarves, halflings and elfs, but those are rarer. Living conditions are very tough for the Nulfirth, and those who reach adult age are generally hardened by their survival. Magic is not widely accepted by the Nulfirth. Most are ok with it, but prefer it away from them (and don't like being involved with it). A few are very intolerant. The common language spoken by the south Nulfirth people is called the Cold Nulfirther. Younger people (20 years old or less) would also speak the Khathan language. In the north of the Glasrath Mountains, Nulfirth people speak a dialect called Sun Nulfirther, and the official Khathan language.

The Kinbarak people are made of dwarves, living in the Glasrath Mountains in the Naragzah Dwarven Empire or in the eastern mountain range. To the west of the Naragzah mountains lies the Thymar people, which are mostly Dragonborn. Both Naragzah and Thymar people are more open to magic, as it permeates their lives closer to their day to day. Many would still prefer to be distant to it, and would turn a blind eye to it. The Naragzah empire speaks the High Dwarven, while the Thymar people speak Draconic.

In general, the more south you go, the tougher and meaner the Nulfirth people are. For those who have travelled through the southern road, you've heard of clans and tribes in the region that practised human sacrifice rituals and even cannibalism.

### Religions

Most of the population in the region follow the Yotunn Ancestors religion (a folk belief). Towards the northern coastal areas there are some organised religions too (Faletism to the west and Mercian Faith to the east). Further into the south, another folk religion is followed - Trow Ancestors.

### Biomes and climate

You see that most of the region is a cold desert, called the Jade Wasteland. Average yearly temperatures are mostly around 0C, but it gets much colder at night. The average is also much lowered closer to the mountains (-11C and below). It is a bit warmer in the coastal areas (2C), where one finds taiga and cold forests. You remember from the past that there are very long winters (3 to 5 years) every 20 years or so. During the coldest part in the winter, average temperatures could be up to 20C lower than described above. There are also summers, which tend to be short (less than 1 year), where average temperatures are 10 to 15 degrees warmer than normal. The very dim winter days tend to be as short as 4 hours, while high summer nights don't even exist.

The very large desert in the region is known as the Desolate Flats

## North Kathan Empire

### Linhe

All this cities (except Gimorkoc, which still follows the Yotunn Ancestors religion) have been over the decades converting to the northern religion known as Faletism. You are also told the northern cities do not speak the same common language as you do. The common language you've been speaking until now on the region is called Cold Nulfirther. In the northern cities they speak a dialect of this language called Sun Nulfirther, and also the official Khathan language. The Dust elves will speak all of these.
