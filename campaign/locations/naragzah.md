## About mines

The mine caves are very tall, with most main ways well above 10m tall. The tunnels are also very wide (sometimes kilometres), with full height for about 50-100m in width in the centre, while the borders are where excavation, extraction and processing takes place. The centre is dedicated to the main mine logistics, which rely on giant lizards that run a chain cycle, pulling massive mine carts round the mine. Half tunnels are built on the top part of abandoned extraction areas, and these are living accommodations and civil spaces. Multiple ditches are built on the tunnels, where sewage and animal waste is collected. Clean water still runs on a few heightened ditches.

Dwarves funnel and filter light (and air, naturally) down into their dwelling caverns via long diamante-lined shafts, the same design that the timeclock uses. Similar structures are used, closer to the surface, to light the large fields of vegetation.

Alternatively to light clockworks, the mineral Sunstone can be heated and would radiate light primarily in the portion of the spectrum needed by plants â€” which made for rather strange lighting, since plants primarily use blue and red light. It could also be let sit in the sunlight, after which it would radiate more of a full spectrum for five or six times as long as that exposure. Sunstone is thus used anywhere the dwarves want growing plants, usually carved into ovoids about the size of a typical soda can. An underground city had about three times the amount of sunstone actually needed for lighting, one portion in use, another portion in storage for replacing the ones that started getting dim, and the third portion being heated.

Sewage is the nutrient source. It isn't used directly, but is composted with vegetable table scraps plus sawdust and wood chips. The compost is mixed into existing soil and spread across especially level cavern floors or on terraces lining the sides of caverns. When a new section of farming area is opened up the dwarves have been known to actually import solid waste from humans, both human waste and animal manure, along with vast amounts of sawdust and wood chips from logging and lumber operations, to make huge amounts of compost. The first layer in a new field in a cavern is rubble, waste from rock carving in pieces walnut-size or smaller, then river sand and gravel topped with ordinary dirt, and finally their compost soil mix.

## The Tolfoddund Mines

The southern mine system on the Glasrath Mountains was created by dwarves coming from the town of Tolfoddund, two centuries ago (3671 NC). These dwarves were not as advanced as the Nargun dwarves, but made enough wealth by trading dwarven goods with Watheton (especially Yeswite), which then traded them to other peoples of the Kuzar County and, more broadly, with the Khathan empire.

The mine's southern entrance is 90 Km through a clean trail on the foot of the mountains, northeast from Watheton. The mine system is roughly 50 x 50 Km. These mines were home for 2800 dwarves in its apex prosperity but, around the year 3867 NC it was raided by the dragonborn clans from Nurderad. Most of the people of the region do not know that the raid was done by the dragonborn, as it was executed very fast and silently. The Nurderad raided the mines due to control from Aivridyt, operating under the power of The Silk - but very few would know that (none in the region). With the dragonborn, also came a necromancer, which is why there will be undead in the mines. The raid did not advance to the Nargun mines, but due to the necromancer spells, a horde of undead started invading the cities of the Nargun dwarves. This is why the passes between both systems will all be sealed.

The trail from Watheton ends in the bottom of the Glasrath Mountains, with a colossal entrance to the Tolfoddund mines. The massive main door is broken and left open.

After entering, the group find themselves in a very rough large room, which gives access to the actual mine through a 10m tall arch. In this room, there are logistics equipment (crates, barrels), chains and platforms for lifting. It smells of animal manure.

Everywhere you see is filled with signs of battle. You see dwarven and other taller humanoid armours, equipment and weapons. You also see the carcasses of very few of the giant lizards, and none of humanoid creatures.

## The Nargun Mines and the City of Khathadzig

The Nargun was a strong Dwarven empire founded in 3217 NC.

In 3867 NC, when the Tolfoddund mines were raided, the Nargun mines closed the intermine access to protect themselves against the incoming undead. Two years later, undead started arriving from the Ammuinoth too, on the south of the intermine - attacking both the mines and the Khathadzig city. During the months of battle that followed, Orduki Fieryshoulder, the Nargun King, was killed with all his family. The body of the youngest heir (Gitmoc Fieryshoulder) was never found - and because of that the Greybow regent never took the title of king. They continue in search for Gitmoc.

In 3872 NC the Nargun finally decided to abandon the Khathadzig city, moving all the population to the intermine.

The city of Khathadzig is surrounded by farms that are set on large faults, with bronze sheets covering it from wind, rain and snow. On these faults, coal is alit for heat, and compost from the mines is used to grow food for the inhabitants.
