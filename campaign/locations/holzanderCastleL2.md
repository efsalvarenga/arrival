### H208 (CR 2)

**Mention an invisible field in the air that somehow seizes onto and discorporates whatever it touches, like some sort of slow-acting stasis or disintegration field.** Active successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot it. Even then, it looks like an out-of-focus disturbance in the air, not a solid object.

When the dire gelatinous cube first starts its turn with 28 or fewer hit points, it reflexively strikes the cracked holding tank as a bonus action. This ruptures the tank and floods the room with ooze plasma. Every space from the top of the stairs to the door into Area 202 quickly becomes ankle-deep in ooze plasma, making it difficult terrain and dealing (2) 1d4 acid damage to every creature standing in the stuff at the start of their turn. The dire gelatinous cube heals 18 (4d4 + 8) hit points thanks to the infusion of plasma. In addition, every creature in that area when the tank is ruptured must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone as the corrosive plasma envelops their feet. The cube tries to engulf as many prone characters as possible, and prone characters attempt to save against the attack with disadvantage.

Finally, just because the cube is eventually killed doesn’t mean it stops being a threat. It can still block the passage (invisibly), and it’s still powerfully acidic to anyone and anything attempting to climb over it or squeeze through it.

### H216 Scriptorium

**Timeline destination (d10 roll)**

1. *27023 years in the past, low accuracy due to the Colligation of Epochs: Construction of the Ammuinoth.* The characters are in a natural cavern, with a single tunnel that goes east and ends in a wellbore opened to the surface above. Ancient Dwarves and Elves are building the Ammuinoth in the region.

2. *23521 years in the past, low accuracy due to the Colligation of Epochs: Awakening of the Kyri.* The characters are in a natural cavern, with a single tunnel that goes east. The opening after the tunnel has a fully built Ammuinoth, with a passage to the surface. The construction utilises proto-seraphic engines and the existing upward wellbore has been vastly expanded expanded to the depths of the earth. The entire area has become an immense city with Deep Dwarves and Deep Elves.

3. *18009 years in the past, low accuracy due to the Colligation of Epochs: War for Guemenos.* The characters are in a natural cavern, with one single tunnel that goes north. Four savage-looking dwarves squat around a fire, roasting meat on sticks. The dwarves cry out in an difficult to recognise, guttural dwarvish language and grab stone-tipped spears lying in the dirt. If someone speaks with them in dwarvish they explain that a battle has been happening between two divine forces for the last 3000 years. If characters go through the tunnel, they can see scenes of the battle.

4. *9899 years in the past, low accuracy due to the Colligation of Epochs: After the Great Purge.* The characters are in a natural cavern, with one single tunnel that goes north. The cavern has been converted into a temple to Mammon, god of greed and madness. The room is swelteringly hot from an immense oven shaped like a monstrously fat humanoid that stands in the southern portion. Its open belly serves as the firebox, and flames within it are the only illumination. Six [cultists](https://open5e.com/monsters/cultist) and one [cult fanatic](https://open5e.com/monsters/cult-fanatic) in robes kneel before it. A proto-anak, bound and gagged, lies on a table that can be tipped up to slide the creature into the blazing furnace. If characters do nothing, the sacrifice continues. If characters intervene, the cultists fight to the death. The freed proto-anak is grateful but wants only to return to his village.

5. *6512 years in the past, low accuracy due to the Colligation of Epochs: Brezal Paths umbilicals are awoken.* The characters are in a natural cavern with a collapsed ceiling, with one single tunnel that goes north. The collapsed ceiling gives access the Ammuinoth. A flux of bright green high energy is going through the tunnels, and leaves behind some green mucous. The characters land in the midst of a battle between six [duergar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16850-duergar) and two [gricks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16912-grick). No matter who wins, they aren’t welcoming toward the party.
6. *498 years in the past, high accuracy: before the Great Depart.* The walls and furnishings of the library are ornate. Three elves are in the room, reading or sorting material on the shelves. They look at the characters with mild curiosity. They’ve seen the construct before, or at least heard about its rare appearances from previous caretakers of the scriptorium. This is the first time it’s been accompanied by anyone other than the clockwork servants, though these elves might not know that. How long the construct remains is up to you. The elves are friendly and willing to talk, but they won’t allow any material to be taken from their library. They speak only archaic Elvish (which is difficult to understand) and Draconic. Should the characters decide to get hostile, these elves use the stats of an archmage, an assassin, and a gladiator. When the construct fires up to leave, the elves quickly step out of its range and remain behind in their own time.
7. *1500 years in the future, iterum 982AC123.* The chambers are barely recognisable from their earlier features. The hole in the floor of Area 215 has been repaired. Area 218 has been converted into a throne room for a clockwork king attended by six [clockwork soldiers](https://www.5esrd.com/database/creature/clockwork-soldier/) (Creature Codex) and four courtiers ([clockwork servants](https://www.5esrd.com/database/creature/clockwork-servant/)). They have, of course, heard tales of the shining blue deity that appeared briefly to their forebears generations ago but never imagined it would return in their runtimes. King Zakchi assumes the characters are the organic slaves of the time construct and the obviously superior clockwork servants, and he tends to ignore them or even become slightly offended if characters speak to him directly.

8. *15000 years in the future, iterum D358A-B Uncreated.* Doomsday has arrived, the characters are in the complete dark with only the floor around the construct holding them.
9. *50,000 years in the future, iterum 3.* Undead from the Drylands have taken control of the now unrecognisable area. A wight, a ghast, and three ghouls are prowling through the chambers. The architecture looks as if the whole place was sculpted from worm-eaten bone. Over its bulky armor, the wight wears grave-stained priestly robes of dark maroon with a bright purple sash. It confronts the characters in Darakhul that has evolved to the point where it’s incomprehensible; it switches to nearly unintelligible Common if they don’t understand its first attempts. The wight-priest demands to know why the intruders defy the holy commands of Syrinx. It does not explain what this means, and if characters protest their innocence in any way, the undead attack in a righteous fury. More undead can join in if you want to up the ante.
10. *75,000 years in the future, realisation 789S.* By this time, the upper layers are gone, blasted away by some titanic cataclysm. The area is open to the sky, which is wreathed in sheets of perpetual green flame. The dominant life form is chuuls, and they’ve become considerably more intelligent over the millennia. Two [chuuls](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#chuul_mm) stand nearby. Their stats are identical to standard chuuls except they have an Intelligence score of 24 and telepathy (240 feet). They are only momentarily perturbed by the arrival of the time construct and the characters. One of the chuuls issues a telepathic command to “surrender the devices and prepare for cranial cessation.” The other chuul levels a complex metal device about 9 feet long at the characters. The device is a lightning gun capable of shooting a lightning bolt every other round (100-foot line; 8d6 lightning damage; save DC 13; can be fired only by someone with chuul claws and telepathy).
