## Info Block

## City summary

- **One liner:** Old and poor desert city, with uneducated population
- **Religion**: Mostly Yotunn Ancestors, with some Faletism
- **Culture**: Nulfirth
- **Races**: mixed dwarf, gnomes, humans and dust elves.

Groups of fractious survivors claim sections of this small city's ruins, scavenging and skirmishing over territory and resources. The survivors are unified in their commitment to silence, to avoid attracting the notice of zombies - and whoever makes their home in the ominously lit Deovan Temple overlooking the ruins.
