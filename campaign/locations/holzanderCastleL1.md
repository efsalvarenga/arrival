## H114 Mystra's door

- Location: [Mystra's Door](../locations/holzanderCastle.md#Mystra's%20Door)
- Draw: Learn where the door is located for finding it from above
- Password in ancient Elvish: "*Edr- dolenpant fen, a let golodh n-*" which means "Open resourceful door, and let knowledge be"
- From the desert side it connects to [dannamore](../locations/dannamore.md)

- Access to the surface is on the collapsed tunnel close to the Holzander's catacombs.
- The tunnel goes up for about 1 km, and then there is a silver door that is magically locked by a Mystra protection spell [WIS Religion DC 15].
- The key to open can be found in the library in Mystra's temple [WIS Investigation DC 15], but can also be remembered by Amyria [WIS Religion DC 18].
- In an ancient Elvish language: "Héri -o mysterime, palime- sina door ar láv- us varna pak", which means "Lady of mystery, open this door and allow us safe passage"
- After the door, it is another 500m to get to the surface. The access to the surface is hidden in the middle of the desert with a large wooden trap door. It has been buried for a long time.
- After finding the door, even without unlocking it, PCs can try to estimate the location of the entrance on the surface [INT Investigation DC 18] and then find it from above [WIS Survival DC 16].
