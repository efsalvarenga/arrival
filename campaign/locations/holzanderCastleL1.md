# Castle of Holzander Level 1

## H113 Catacombs and vision of the Ophaire

- Location: [Catacombs](../locations/holzanderCastle.md#Catacombs) (as set out in SC45)
- Threat: PCs may think there is something here, but except for the information of the Ophaire, there is nothing. 
- Conflicts: Incoming undead never stops - Keep adding foes as necessary to make this area a tough one. A rule of thumb, when combat starts roll a 1d4. That is the number of monsters that (if below), would trigger another incoming foe (from table below). When a new foe comes, roll again. And keep doing it.
- End conditions: The PCs realise there is nothing here for them.

| 1d12 roll | Outcome            |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| 1 - 4     | Skeletons (CR 1/4) |
| 5 - 7     | Shadows (CR 1/2)   |
| 8 - 9     | Wights (CR 3)      |
| 10        | Spectres (CR 5)    |
| 11        | Wraights (CR 5)    |
| 12        | Bodak (CR 6)       |

```encounter
name: Catacombs
creatures:
 - 1: Wight
 - 1d2: Shadow
 - 1d4: Skeleton
```

Ossuary connects to the Ophaire. If PCs look into the pool they see this and, on a mountain slope that takes to the pool, a contiguous line of undead climbing towards the PCs in slow motion. Any PCs that look into the pool must do a sanity check [DC 10] or lose a point of sanity and gain a short term madness. Closing the portal is beyond the characters level, or even anyone on this level on the castle [Arcana DC 20 to realise that].

## H114 Mystra's door

- Location: [Mystra's Door](../locations/holzanderCastle.md#Mystra's%20Door)
- Draw: Learn where the door is located for finding it from above
- Password in ancient Elvish: "*Edr- dolenpant fen, a let golodh n-*" which means "Open resourceful door, and let knowledge be"
- From the desert side it connects to [dannamore](../locations/dannamore.md)

- Access to the surface is on the collapsed tunnel close to the Holzander's catacombs.
- The tunnel goes up for about 1 km, and then there is a silver door that is magically locked by a Mystra protection spell [WIS Religion DC 15].
- The key to open can be found in the library in Mystra's temple [WIS Investigation DC 15], but can also be remembered by Amyria [WIS Religion DC 18].
- In an ancient Elvish language: "Héri -o mysterime, palime- sina door ar láv- us varna pak", which means "Lady of mystery, open this door and allow us safe passage"
- After the door, it is another 500m to get to the surface. The access to the surface is hidden in the middle of the desert with a large wooden trap door. It has been buried for a long time.
- After finding the door, even without unlocking it, PCs can try to estimate the location of the entrance on the surface [INT Investigation DC 18] and then find it from above [WIS Survival DC 16].
