# Darklake

You found on an old scripture that the lake is controlled by the Cultists of Cuncharn, which is a minor deity under Algath (god that Ghuse follows). The symbol of Cuncharn is the same as the one Ghuse uses (and you found in Nilperto, and the red dragon had - according to the Nargun).

The lake is controlled by the Cultists of [Curcharn, the Boatman and Spirit of the Darklake](../context/religions.md#Curcharn,%20the%20Boatman%20and%20Spirit%20of%20the%20Darklake), which is a minor deity under [Algath, Goddess of Life and Death](../context/religions.md#Algath,%20Goddess%20of%20Life%20and%20Death). The symbol of Cuncharn is the same as the one Ghuse uses (and you found in Nilperto, and the red dragon had - according to the Nargun).
