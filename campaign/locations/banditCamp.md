# Bandit meeting camp
***Bandit meeting camp: Brilliant innovation & Warring council*** 

**Innovation**: grinding a stone like Gaelira's into a dwarven made pot creates a void zone that undead cannot enter.

- E: Bandit leader is loosing his rapport with the band, as the innovation is changing perspectives
- F: Dust Elf merchants that joined the band, and want to explore the possibilities outside just bandity
- C: The innovation requires rare stones and pots made by dwarves, but establishing trading routes with dwarves requires broader dust elven support, which they are not seeking
- T: the innovation components
- P: the camp
