# Tolfonddund Mines

The mine's southern entrance is 90 Km through a clean trail on the foot of the mountains, northeast from Watheton. The mine system is roughly 50 x 50 Km. These mines were home for 2800 dwarves in its apex prosperity but, around the year 3867 NC it was raided by the dragonborn clans from Nurderad. Most of the people of the region do not know that the raid was done by the dragonborn, as it was executed very fast and silently. The Nurderad raided the mines due to control from Aivridyt, operating under the power of The Silk - but very few would know that (none in the region). With the dragonborn, also came a necromancer, which is why there will be undead in the mines. The raid did not advance to the Nargun mines, but due to the necromancer spells, a horde of undead started invading the cities of the Nargun dwarves. This is why the passes between both systems will all be sealed.

The trail from Watheton ends in the bottom of the Glasrath Mountains, with a colossal entrance to the Tolfoddund mines. The massive main door is broken and left open.

After entering, the group find themselves in a very rough large room, which gives access to the actual mine through a 10m tall arch. In this room, there are logistics equipment (crates, barrels), chains and platforms for lifting. It smells of animal manure.

Everywhere you see is filled with signs of battle. You see dwarven and other taller humanoid armours, equipment and weapons. You also see the carcasses of very few of the giant lizards, and none of humanoid creatures.
