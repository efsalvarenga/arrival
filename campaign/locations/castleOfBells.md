# Castle of Bells

![](_aux/Pasted%20image%2020230327224311.png)

Most of the lore about the Forbidden Sepulchre of the Castle of Bells is unknown - but the Nargun advised you to beware that a werewolf took lair in it a few years ago. The werewolf has never been a problem to the Nargun though. The lore about the Ardismouth Tower is also unknown, but it is told a horde of demons lived there a while ago. You were also told to be watchful of the partial collapse of the tunnel close to the tower, where the dwarves have built a rope bridge over the subterranean Dark Lake.
