Stars Without Numbers (SWN) is an OSR system, which allows me to easily reskin a lot published materials since the 80s. Different than old school D&D, SWN has a much simpler class system, with most of the customisation done through background, foci (i.e. feats) and a robust skill system (based on classic Traveler - which is the skill system of the Hostile game too). For SWN I can easily convert any D&D adventure (any version, easier with up to 2e), and Call of Cthulhu (d100 systems) with some small work.

## Character creation guidance

- Character creation on the SWN book, pages 3 to 25. Pre-built characters are available on page 26.
- Classes available: warrior, expert or mix/adventurer (i.e. no magic or psionic powers)
- Character sheet: [fillable pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bM8pMgGjMKao6s-12BjnkQ9MzXhFJ8i2/view?usp=drivesdk), [Google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19vw6EHrl_2-8BcHob2_bxvcpLnVbAHbW3StjrNEFoKg/edit#gid=1671565117) or [freebooter app](https://www.swnfreebooter.net/)

## House rules

- We are in year 2225, which means the maximum available technology is TL4 (SWN 63)
- (tbd) Humanity (sanity) rules to represent mental stress (madness and inhumanity actions and scenes)
- (tbd around level 5) Domain play (i.e.: player driven faction to build a colony, once characters are higher level, and if players are interested in it)
- NB.: Additional flavour from other games are always welcomed (OSR compatible preferred, but anything can be discussed)

### Character advancement

Required XP will use a higher inclination curve (without impact in progress pace), akin traditional OSR. This allows new characters to progress rather quickly to catch up with veterans. XP awarded will be scaled to the dangers the PCs faced on each session.
