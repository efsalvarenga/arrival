## Themes

**Gritty sci-fi**
> Characters are blue collar spacers, working dangerous jobs in the hostility of space. Every hazard is trying to kill characters all the time. Everything in the world that isn’t an active corporate interest is run down, decaying, and stained.
> *List of hazards: lack of oxygen, vacuum, radiation, excessive cold, excessive heat, aliens, alien infections, poisonous atmosphere, high pressure atmosphere, high decompression rate and high gravity acceleration in large bodies.*

**Horror elements**
> Humans are not alone in the universe. Alien predators have been found in multiple worlds, and sometimes even in asteroids. Advanced alien societies had their remnants found by earth explorers, but intelligent life is still to be observed. Some theorists say they have been found, and are among us.

**Political intrigue & treachery**
> Several factions with their own motives and goals. Everyone is out for their own interests, and they’re trustworthy only so long as their interests align with yours. Everyone assumes that deals will be kept only so long as they’re mutually profitable and relationships will only continue as long as they offer benefits to all parties
> Factions are classified in 3 groups:
> - **Technology & resourceful factions**: the strongest group, mostly formed by Mega Corporations and their subsidiaries.
> - **Belief factions**: their Influence is subtle and ideological, mostly formed by religions and conspiracy theorists
> - **Rising authoritative supra-government**: early years of an attempt of Earth governments to regain control from the Mega Corporations hands - the Terran Mandate.

## Starting hook

MegaCorp Leyland-Okuda launched a tender in 2221 for a cosmic water displacement service. In 2222 a group of Brazilian entrepreneurs formed an industrial start-up and won the tender with a development plan for the next 15 years. Two years later, this start-up was hostile took over by Tharsis, and different divisions were assigned to different subsidiaries. Tharsis Mining suddenly became responsible for finding enough water and evaluate the commerciality and risks of possible ice mining plays. Without access to the knowledgeable Brazilians who devised the plan originally, Tharsis Mining had to find suitable professionals for the work outside Tharsis's rank.

In 2025 Tharsis Mining finalising forming the crew that would travel to the Perdurabo system and evaluate the ice mining plays for further development. The location in Perdurabo is a strategic one, as it is close enough to two potential colony customers in neighbouring systems, Crow and Oppenheimer. Another advantage is the existence of the Brightside Mining Station in the system, a poorly managed facility that would be easy to purchase if the exploration proves commerciality of the play.

Perdurabo is a system blazing with the murderous light of a red giant star. The hard-bitten miners of the Brightside Mining Station maintain the only outpost of civilisation in a system filled with lethal light and stellar outlaws. Ancient asteroid sky tombs lie in the vicinity while a seething rebellion boils beneath Brightside Station's steel skin.

You are the crew going to Perdurabo. You main goal is to execute the Exploration Framework that enables the commercial evaluation of the Ice Mine play. A hidden milestone, that will be paid off books, is infiltrating and deteriorating the leadership of Brightside station, so its later acquisition is even cheaper. Contracted roles and milestones are detailed below. Monthly salary is Salary + Multiplier x Profession Rank. Each milestone pays a bonus of 10 times the crew monthly salary.

| Crew member | Contracted profession         | Undercover role            | Ship department | Salary | Multiplier |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- | ------ | ---------- |

- 2 intelligent alien species: Ngar'tho+another one (no gods)
- fight cage pit (champion is hd3?)
- meeting with ai simulation as proxy for the megacorp (2 separate instances )
- Their ship is already in Brightside (the old crew died in an asteroid tomb, the ship was rescued by the fight champion as a bounty job)
