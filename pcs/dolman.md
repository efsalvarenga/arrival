# Dolman Frostbraid

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nf8CCdf0TEB-3kLdnkjSumMrRrrmcTpkqncB5C9LUv8/edit

- [ ] I was abandoned at the doors of the Kiranu mines with days of age in a wooden box warmed with rabbit skin and a stone that no one could name together with letter that read:
> 		Dear fruit of a wandering adventure
> 		A beautiful story that could not be
> 		Your father Bari will nurture you to be an honourable man
- [ ] In the dwarven city of Kiranu everyone knows my story, and I grew up hearing I am not a true Kiranu dwarf.
- [ ] Our family specialise in combining alloys, making smithworks and jewellery.
- [ ] At the age of 35, I enlisted the Kiranu Host.

  - name: Command the wheels
    desc: "*Commit Effort*. You can seize control of any visible vehicle, mechanism, door, or other object with moving parts up to the size of a small ship. If the item was created by you, there is no size limit on what can be controlled. While the Effort remains committed, the object will function exactly as if it were being manipulated, driven or piloted by you.
