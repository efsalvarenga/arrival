There are three levels of civilisations: the mundane (present), the caretakers (long past + present) and the creators (past, lost). 

The mundane civilisation receives foreshadowing/messages from the caretakers, and eventually an expensive invitation to meet them. To execute the visit, a lot of politics amongst different factions are required.

The caretaker civilisation knows how to operate super advanced technology. But they haven't built it, and they haven't met who has built it. 

The creators leave a signature hidden.
