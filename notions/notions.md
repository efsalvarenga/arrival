# Ideas, plans and misc content

## Inbox

- Where is Galiera
- trow culture is of goblinoids (not all bad - but closer to Turnskull other stuff, such as ancient vampires and lycantropes?)
- start the vampire plot before they know it is Gaelira the vampire
- define the utmost enemy of arrival - and think of an overshadowing that enables PCs to hurt it over time (think of Melkor that was hurt by many characters before he was destroyed )
- ask players to work on "prepare to be scared" (Ravenloft pp13)
- adapt Imotra, Gellert and Avryindt to be a dark lord -(VHgtR 39) Gellert is a mind flayer? If not, who is a mind flayer? Imotra might want to have one of the characters as her apprentice (VRgtR 44)
- one of the magic weapons the PCs own has a story connected to part 2
- where is the city of arches?
- what is magic in Guemenos? Science, precious development by ancient civilisation, godbound? define technology scales per province
- acrisae fort location breaks connection between Hincland and Turnskull
- battle with wizard hunting as the goal of the PCs
- campaign theme: alliances with evil 
- If things get ugly with Aivridyt, use the werebear to save PCs
- ask players to suggest legends and heroic tales that their characters like to build lore in the world - and maybe drive adventures
- layers upon layers of abandoned ancient infrastructure (subways from Contact)
- come up with the ancient and middle old empires and cultures, define their ruins and signs - and also how climate was different

## Background & lore

### Secrets
- Shield of beauty is the vampire spreading the Lady Scurvy
	- Galiera and the paragon force were captured by the gaoler, everyone was tortured and killed, but Galiera was spared and sent to Gellert as a present: Galiera was killed, but brought back by the evil gods as a vampire - with the spawn curse with her
	- Lady Scurvy was created by the Shield of Beauty Vampire that took residence in a castle close to Throtha, and it is spreading. It is a vampirism disease that strongly affects all non-human races.
* Linhe is important as it is the last unconquered province of the north desert. Both FFKA and the Mercian take this conquest seriously, but neither wants to escalate it to military or clearly hostile action.
* Something about Gellert and Imotra and the Mercians
* Ghost cavalry (Nazgul) protects access to the NE port to the other dimension for evil
* Ophaire = avernus (1st level of hell)
* secret buried in the Holzanger castle - FFKA with a pact with an evil God created the ghost riders for this god, in exchange for influence in the continent
* the works in the Holzander castle is making the desert even more bare
* immortal men from the past come from the west, dwarves and elves from the east
* A black dragon was seen wandering the Ghost Domain close to the Ammuinoth tunnel fractures
* Olivepia is where the head of the Faletist church sits. It is a religious empire with a strong hand on neighbour empires (other empires are vassals)
- Monsters that pose a threat in the present may have been created as weapons of war by a fallen culture. 
- [ ] Memoria is a forgotten ruin, mostly vanished into the lowland bogs north of Redtower.
- [ ] Some power in the White Forest drew the necromancers of Memoria as it has drawn others to the region.
- [ ] Some power in the White Forest drew the necromancers of Memoria as it has drawn others to the region.
- [ ] To achieve this vision, the Memorians devised a relic called the Light of Memoria to create a bridge to the afterlife and light the way for their ancestors’ spirits to cross into the mortal world.

- Intrigue / sabotage in Olivepia and the West continent: any human empires playing political games as opposed to fighting on the troubled area

- Collect artefacts that together have great power
- PCs get drawn into the darkness
	- Miraak: Undead - gets Relentless Endurance (1/Day). When reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, he can drop to 1 hit point instead. However he should be treated as undead for any rule reason.
