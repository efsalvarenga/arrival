# Ideas, plans and misc content

## Inbox

- define the utmost enemy of arrival - and think of an overshadowing that enables PCs to hurt it over time (think of Melkor that was hurt by many characters before he was destroyed )
- adapt Imotra, Gellert and Avryindt to be a dark lord -(VHgtR 39) Gellert is a mind flayer? If not, who is a mind flayer? Imotra might want to have one of the characters as her apprentice (VRgtR 44)
- where is the city of arches?
- acrisae fort location breaks connection between Hincland and Turnskull
- ask players to suggest legends and heroic tales that their characters like to build lore in the world - and maybe drive adventures
- layers upon layers of abandoned ancient infrastructure (subways from Contact)
- every hex in the map has at least one interesting location / court

## Background & lore

### Secrets
- Where is Galiera: she felt in love and went to marry Reganni and now lives with him in the Kephani Salt Flats.
	- The truth is that she was sent as a present for the completion of the ritual that will make Reganni a Lich. The ritual is already completed, and she is dead and buried in the desert. (She is actually a vampire now, if someone rescues her body and is dirty with blood she will wake up)
	- Gellert wants to use the tower to channel the energy umbilical he will create later
* Something about Gellert and Imotra and the Mercians
* Ophaire = avernus (1st level of hell)
* the works in the Holzander castle is making the desert even more bare
* immortal men (angels) from the past come from the west, dwarves and elves from the east
* A black dragon was seen wandering the Ghost Domain close to the Ammuinoth tunnel fractures
* Olivepia is where the head of the Faletist church sits. It is a religious empire with a strong hand on neighbour empires (other empires are vassals)
* what is magic in Guemenos? Science, precious development by ancient civilisation, godbound? define technology scales per province
* silk infiltration in Nurderad 
* trow culture is of goblinoids (not all bad - but closer to Turnskull other stuff, such as ancient vampires and lycantropes?)
- [ ] Memoria is a forgotten ruin, mostly vanished into the lowland bogs north of Redtower.
- [ ] Some power in the White Forest drew the necromancers of Memoria as it has drawn others to the region.
- [ ] To achieve this vision, the Memorians devised a relic called the Light of Memoria to create a bridge to the afterlife and light the way for their ancestors’ spirits to cross into the mortal world.

### Themes (??)

- Intrigue / sabotage in Olivepia and the West continent: any human empires playing political games as opposed to fighting on the troubled area
- The insatiable thirst for control by the good and evil children of the gods. With touches of troubled heroes (rage and fury that lies in their own hearts) - how to implement that?
- Collect artefacts that together have great power
- campaign closes with defeating the divine supremacy in Turnskull and either destroying its engine (GB200) or banishing loquiroth
- Edrahil (and Acrisae) are Angels, Kyri are Eldritch and Made Gods and misbegotten
	- tier 4 are 50 HD on godbound
	- parasite gods can be on either side, they are trapped in specific locations - Gellert is one?
	- god brain is an uncreated from the void
- PCs get drawn into the darkness
	- Miraak: Undead - gets Relentless Endurance (1/Day). When reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, he can drop to 1 hit point instead. However he should be treated as undead for any rule reason.
	- Dolman: Vampire
	- Someone else: Lycantropy
