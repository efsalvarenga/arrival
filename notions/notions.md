## Background & lore

### Secrets
- Where is Galiera: she felt in love and went to marry Reganni and now lives with him in the Kephani Salt Flats.
	- The truth is that she was sent as a present for the completion of the ritual that will make Reganni a Lich. The ritual is already completed, and she is dead and buried in the desert. (She is actually a vampire now, if someone rescues her body and is dirty with blood she will wake up)
	- Gellert wants to use the tower to channel the energy umbilical he will create later
* Something about Gellert and Imotra and the Mercians
* Ophaire = avernus (1st level of hell)
* the works in the Holzander castle is making the desert even more bare
* A black dragon was seen wandering the Ghost Domain close to the Ammuinoth tunnel fractures
* silk infiltration in Nurderad 

## Arcs & hooks

### Scenes

- Roll for adventure hooks in falkovia
- mission to get something quick to help with the campaign?
- Invitation to Glasrath by Ghuse
- cultists where some of them are just drugged and not actually evil
- Werebear t√° acorrentado sendo flagelado por undead
- Werebear mentions he has seen a shadow dragon
- Segarus FFKA East Chapter captain is nosy on the character if they get to red tower: Intent is to claim the destruction of Gellert if PCs do it. For that he might appoint a knight to go with PCs (as spy).

#### Unused scenes



### Snoozed hooks

- the guy that amyria spoke about destroying sergarus approaches her
- Aivridyt's eggs hatch in the Darklake
- 3878.4 NC Theklurth will come back for a revenge on the party (and Miraak)
- 3894 NC Theklurth's child (demon dragonborn) will revenge it's mother
- Huge shadow dragon comes looking for his mate (Avryindt)
- If things get ugly with Aivridyt, use the werebear to save PCs

### Chapters

- create chapter based on a random mythos aberration (sl177)

### Long arcs

- Seraphic engines: only Acrisae and Turnskull have them, but they haven't built them
- part 2 closes with the nots of brezal paths in linhe undone
- part 3 closes with impeding The Void to become one with the engine of Hincland and achieve divine supremacy (GB200)
- but being incarnate Morgoth was afraid. As he grew in malice his power passed into the creatures of evil and he become more earth bound
- some spirit of great power that takes human form and accompanied a mortal

### Themes (??)

- Intrigue / sabotage in Olivepia and the West continent: any human empires playing political games as opposed to fighting on the troubled area
- The insatiable thirst for control by the good and evil children of the gods. With touches of troubled heroes (rage and fury that lies in their own hearts) - how to implement that?
- Collect artefacts that together have great power
- campaign closes with defeating the divine supremacy in Turnskull and either destroying its engine (GB200) or banishing loquiroth
- Edrahil (and Acrisae) are Angels, Kyri are Eldritch and Made Gods and misbegotten
	- tier 4 are 50 HD on godbound
	- parasite gods can be on either side, they are trapped in specific locations - Gellert is one?
	- god brain is an uncreated from the void
- PCs get drawn into the darkness
	- Miraak: Undead - gets Relentless Endurance (1/Day). When reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, he can drop to 1 hit point instead. However he should be treated as undead for any rule reason.
	- Dolman: Vampire
	- Someone else: Lycantropy
