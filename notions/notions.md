- how time tributary works sideways? Think for amyria, miraak, Dolman. Getting old is easy to implement.
	- guilf: back to level 1 (can change the bard school to the spirits at level 3)
	- Anyria
	- Dolman
	- wyvern
	- Kethra: back to level 1 (can choose a fighter)
- check random tables on DMG for chapters and campaign
- ask players to work on "prepare to be scared" (Ravenloft pp13)
- adapt Gellert and Avryindt to be a dark lord - Gellert is a mind flayer? If not, who is a mind flayer?
- integrate Miraak's story
- integrate pc sheets into JSON
- integrate Nurderad and Miraak's story arc into world context
- use combat tracker on obsidian
- copy monster data base from sky flourish 
- If things get ugly with Aivridyt, use the werebear to save PCs
- ask players to suggest legends and heroic tales that their characters like to build lore in the world - and maybe drive adventures
- great magic items would have people wanting them
- read DMG for creating NPCs and integrate it to the template.
- add some detail about Westeros and Anthea (south)
- expand on PCs loved ones?
- layers upon layers of abandoned ancient infrastructure (subways from Contact)
- add Mercian foreshadowing by playing it with factions
- come up with the ancient and middle old empires and cultures, define their ruins and signs - and also how climate was different
- define technology scales per province

## Background & lore

### Secrets
- Shield of beauty is the vampire spreading the Lady Scurvy
	- Galiera and the paragon force were captured by the gaoler, everyone was tortured and killed, but Galiera was spared and sent to Gellert as a present: Galiera was killed, but brought back by the evil gods as a vampire - with the spawn curse with her
	- Lady Scurvy was created by the Shield of Beauty Vampire that took residence in a castle close to Throtha, and it is spreading. It is a vampirism disease that strongly affects all non-human races.
- Sulpraxae are run by Seraphic Engines
- Cold desert was created by a wall of fire magic gone awry in the old days' wars. This wall of fire burnt for for hundreds of years in the entire planet. Became no-man's land for the rest of the war. It used to be a forested land in the time of Iopothae.
- Duergar and Drows were enslaved when they went too deep
* Linhe is important as it is the last unconquered province of the north desert. Both FFKA and the Mercian take this conquest seriously, but neither wants to escalate it to military or clearly hostile action.
* Something about Gellert and Imotra and the Mercians
* Ghost cavalry (Nazgul) protects access to the NE port to the other dimension for evil
* Ophaire = avernus (1st level of hell)
* secret buried in the Holzanger castle - FFKA with a pact with an evil God created the ghost riders for this god, in exchange for influence in the continent
* the works in the Holzander castle is making the desert even more bare
* immortal men from the past come from the west, dwarves and elves from the east
* A black dragon was seen wandering the Ghost Domain close to the Ammuinoth tunnel fractures
* This confluence and pooling of energy is all but unique in the Castle of Holzanger, and it’s the most closely guarded secret about the site. The only way for low-level characters to uncover a bit of arcane history this esoteric would be to spend at least a month in research at one of the great libraries of the continent — or a few hours in the Arcane Scriptorium beneath the citadel.
* Olivepia is where the head of the Faletist church sits. It is a religious empire with a strong hand on neighbour empires (other empires are vassals)
- age of dragons in the past?
- Monsters that pose a threat in the present may have been created as weapons of war by a fallen culture. 
- [ ] The Gaoler talking with someone about a magic door to the castle and the Dannamore Hold ruins, and that he had the key

### Rumours
- Random rumours [curatedRumours](campaign/resources/curatedRumours.md)

## Arcs & hooks

### Scenes

- Tales of the Glasrath battle, and the fall of the Glasrath Champions is sang by bards
- Brilhorte & Salaico' stories
- Werebear tá acorrentado sendo flagelado por undead
- Werebear mentions he has seen a shadow dragon
- Demon on level 2 can explain the brezal paths: can be freed into a magic item 
- Segarus FFKA East Chapter captain is nosy on the character if they get to red tower: Intent is to claim the destruction of Gellert if PCs do it. For that he might appoint a knight to go with PCs (as spy).


### Snoozed hooks

- Finding the harpies or owlbear on the way out in Level 0
- Aivridyt's eggs hatch in the Darklake
- 3878.4 NC Theklurth will come back for a revenge on the party (and Miraak)
- 3894 NC Theklurth's child (demon dragonborn) will revenge it's mother

### Chapters

- Montagem de uma viagem longa, including desert beast tracking the characters
- Competing groups trying to retrieve something from somewhere
- When will the dragonborn come in the story?
- Next dungeon: look at dungeon hazards dmg105 and rules DMG290
- Later faction: knights of the restless (https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-L8JrLtObw8AvcFw4JcW)
- PCs hunt (Tom&Jerry) their own dark characters
- Thymar and Kiranu can be called to save Glasrath
- offer dark gift when the angel hound is saved

### Long arcs

- Acrisae are orcs? Other alternative species... And they were destroyed by evil humans?
- Seraphic engines: only Acrisae and Turnskull have them, but they haven't built them

### Themes (??)

- Dark fantasy / horror / evil empire of the dead in the south and all areas with Lady Scurvy
- Intrigue / sabotage in Olivepia and the West continent: any human empires playing political games as opposed to fighting on the troubled area
- The insatiable thirst for control by the good and evil children of the gods. With touches of troubled heroes (rage and fury that lies in their own hearts) - how to implement that?
- Collect artefacts that together have great power
- PCs get drawn into the darkness
	- Miraak: Undead - gets Relentless Endurance (1/Day). When reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, he can drop to 1 hit point instead. However he should be treated as undead for any rule reason.
	- Dolman: Vampire
	- Someone else: Lycantropy
