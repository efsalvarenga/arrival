# Cultures and Species

### Nulfirth

Nomadic and/or rural in nature. Very few cities lie in the desert, but some small cities are found in the coastal areas. Most of the Nulfirth people are mixed breed between several species such as dust elves, dwarves, gnomes, halflings and humans.

Living conditions are very tough for the Nulfirth, and those who reach adult age are generally hardened by their survival. Magic is not widely accepted by the Nulfirth. Most are ok with it, but prefer it away from them (and don't like being involved with it). A few are very intolerant.

The common language spoken by the south Nulfirth people is called the Cold Nulfirther. Younger people (20 years old or less) would also speak the Khathan language. In the north of the Glasrath Mountains, Nulfirth people speak a dialect called Sun Nulfirther, and the official Khathan language.

### Kimbarak

The Kimbarak people are made of dwarves, living in the Glasrath Mountains in the [Naragzah Dwarven Empire](realms.md#Naragzah%20Dwarven%20Empire) or in [Kiranu](realms.md#Kiranu), in the eastern mountain range. They are more open to magic than the Nulfirth people. The Naragzah Empire and Kiranu both speak the High Kimbarak language.

***Kimbarak Mines***

The mine caves are very tall, with most main ways well above 10m tall. The tunnels are also very wide (sometimes kilometres), with full height for about 50-100m in width in the centre, while the borders are where excavation, extraction and processing takes place. The centre is dedicated to the main mine logistics, which rely on giant lizards that run a chain cycle, pulling massive mine carts round the mine. Half tunnels are built on the top part of abandoned extraction areas, and these are living accommodations and civil spaces. Multiple ditches are built on the tunnels, where sewage and animal waste is collected. Clean water still runs on a few heightened ditches.

Dwarves funnel and filter light (and air, naturally) down into their dwelling caverns via long diamante-lined shafts, the same design that the timeclock uses. Similar structures are used, closer to the surface, to light the large fields of vegetation.

Alternatively to light clockworks, the mineral Sunstone can be heated and would radiate light primarily in the portion of the spectrum needed by plants — which made for rather strange lighting, since plants primarily use blue and red light. It could also be let sit in the sunlight, after which it would radiate more of a full spectrum for five or six times as long as that exposure. Sunstone is thus used anywhere the dwarves want growing plants, usually carved into ovoids about the size of a typical soda can. An underground city had about three times the amount of sunstone actually needed for lighting, one portion in use, another portion in storage for replacing the ones that started getting dim, and the third portion being heated.

Sewage is the nutrient source. It isn't used directly, but is composted with vegetable table scraps plus sawdust and wood chips. The compost is mixed into existing soil and spread across especially level cavern floors or on terraces lining the sides of caverns. When a new section of farming area is opened up the dwarves have been known to actually import solid waste from humans, both human waste and animal manure, along with vast amounts of sawdust and wood chips from logging and lumber operations, to make huge amounts of compost. The first layer in a new field in a cavern is rubble, waste from rock carving in pieces walnut-size or smaller, then river sand and gravel topped with ordinary dirt, and finally their compost soil mix.

### Thymar

To the west of the Naragzah mountains lies the Thymar people, which are mostly Dragonborn. They are more open to magic than the Nulfirth people. Thymar dragonborn speak Draconic.

### Mercian

In the depths of [Hincland](arrival/context/realms.md#Hincland), a shadowy populace, known as the Mercians, slumbered beneath the cloak of their enigmatic culture. Once, they had been devout adherents of an ancient faith, steeped in the mysteries of forgotten gods. But now, those sacred rites and pious convictions had withered like the pages of an unread tome, eclipsed by the looming dominance of greater faiths, such as the relentless juggernaut of [Faletism](arrival/context/religions.md#Faletism) and the ancestral echoes of the [Yotunn](arrival/context/religions.md#Yotunn).

These Mercians, primarily human in blood but bearing the weight of forsaken traditions, thrived on the resonance of tales spun in the ethereal embrace of moonlight. They reveled in the harmonious cadence of music and the hypnotic allure of dance, though their intentions were no longer directed toward veneration of deities. Instead, they danced upon the graves of ancient gods, their souls divorced from their religious lineage. Their oral tradition wove narratives of forgotten heroes, fantastical creatures, and inscrutable gods who had lost their lustre in the passage of ages. Music and dance, once sacred rites, now became a medium through which they celebrated what little remained of their elusive heritage. Runes, etched in the very fabric of their culture, bore the weight of divination and arcane mastery. 

Clad in garments as dark as the abyss and adorned with amulets and tattoos that spoke of mysteries untold, the Mercians fashioned an identity born from the ash of ancient faiths. Their attire served as a testament to their status and a proclamation of their enigmatic lineage. Personal freedom was their beacon, the land their sacred tether, and the unity of their people their guardian in the silent hours of the night.

#### Antinom
***Source: aole124***

The Antinom is a living curse-weapon devised by some ancient sorcerer-king to bring down the civilisations of his rivals. They are effectively immortal, though they occasionally reproduce by infecting a human host with a curse that gradually transforms them into a new Antinom.

An Antinom appears to be a normal baseline human of whatever ethnicity predominates in a region. They are invariably rebels, renegades, or demagogues against some presiding power or generally-accepted moral code; they denounce it and work to topple it through allied disaffected humans. They subtly inflict their curses on such targets as would most destabilise whatever they are fighting, and will push the point until their rebel cell is destroyed or their target is discredited or brought low.

The Antinom does not stop at that point, however, because its entire purpose is to break, ruin, and discredit any organising principles. It continues to tear down and denounce all possible replacements for the fallen edifice, seeking to keep the local humans in a constant ferment of struggle. Even basic ties between family and loved ones are anathema to it, and it will work to isolate and atomize all the people around it as much as its greater plans allow.

An Antinom will continue its social destruction until it is killed or until it judges that success is impossible. If necessary, it will swiftly flee to a different land to target the institutions there.

## Dragons

Dragons are remnant survivors of some ancient age be- fore the rule of the Outsiders, creatures birthed by civili- zations now dead beyond any mortal death. It is unclear whether they were meant to be guardians, exemplars, or gods, if such a distinction even existed in that age. What is clear is that they are some of the most powerful crea- tures in the Latter Earth, with even the least of them having the power of a Legate and the greatest wielding the might of an Imperator.

Physically, most dragons resemble winged semi-rep- tilian creatures at least sixty feet long from fangs to tail- tip. Their size seems to reflect their overall power, with the mightiest recorded specimens being at least six hun- dred feet long, with a quarter-mile-wide wingspan. Vari- ant draconic forms have also been recorded, including one composed of articulated metal and at least one that appeared in a shape that modern human visual senses could not coherently process.

Dragons spend most of their time “dreaming”, locked in a reverie recalling their former civilization and their life during its zenith. Given the limits of their memory and the unfathomable ages since their creation, they of- ten have difficulty recollecting details and specifics; they find this forgetting unendurably painful. To forestall it, they gather objects and treasures that somehow remind them of their past, hoarding them with obsessive care. To steal a dragon’s treasure is to steal a fragment of its past, and it will go to great lengths to recover the item and punish the thief. Most dragons would prefer death to the loss of their hoard.

Dragons generally despise interacting with the modern world; its existence is a painful reminder of all they have lost. Sometimes they can be propitiated with a treasure that somehow reminds them of the past, or engage humans to acquire some token that they dare not leave their hoard to obtain. Payment is usually made in priceless artifacts that are worthless to them. At times a dragon can be persuaded to give an answer to some deep question, but they will almost never leave their hoard unguarded to perform physical favors. They resent any time not spent in remembering their lost happiness.

Dragons usually lair deep within wildernesses and arratus, usually inhabiting ruins that somehow remind them of their former lives. Sometimes they permit less- er servitors to revere them, if only to have convenient minions for building defenses and keeping watch, while others are too paranoid of thieves to endure the company of anything but mindless automatons and constructs. At their worst, these fearful titans might leave their lairs to destroy any potential thieves in the lands nearby.

Unsurprisingly, every dragon has a fearsome array of powers, and few heroes have ever managed to best them without devising careful plans or acquiring special occult artifacts. Among the lesser dragons not imbued with an Imperator’s might, the following traits have been commonly observed. Individuals doubtless vary.

### Greater dragons

- Originated as cerulean (eldritch and psionic) metamorphosis of the Sorcerer-Kings of Terra (Dark-Sun).
- Initial metamorphosis only reachable to 20 HD sorcerer-kings. Metamorphosis is completed around 30 HD.
- Generally immense creatures with 600 ft deformed bodies (long necks, large bellies, etc) with wingspans of 700 ft. Some would have 4 limbs and 2 wings, others would have their arms integrated in wings (like Wyverns)

### Lesser dragons

- Originated as mud experiments of the greater dragons
- Bred to not reproduce, although a few specimens were able to have descendants
- They have good form and proportions, as classic dragons
- They grow from a 1 ft wyrmling sizes, when born, or 5 ft wyrmling sizes, when created.

| Class    | Age          | HD    | Size      |
| -------- | ------------ | ----- | --------- |
| Ancient  | 800+ y.o.    | 20-25 | 80-100 ft |
| Adult    | 100-800 y.o. | 15-20 | 50-80 ft  |
| Young    | 10-100 y.o.  | 10-15 | 15-50 ft  |
| Wyrmling | <10 y.o.     | 5-10  | 1-15 ft   |
