### Cloak of Bitter Luck
***Mercian cloak, requires attunement***

Its textile was etched with ancient runes that glowed when activated with a pulsing, ethereal energy. The cloak had been woven by a long-dead wizard, who had imbued it with the power to harness the luck through air itself. It was said that the wizard had met a terrible fate, his body withered away from overuse of the cloak' power. But despite the risks, many still sought out the cloak, eager to wield its incredible power and claim their place among the greatest mages in the land. The cloak is full of runes written in Qualith.

- You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while you wear this cloak.
- Any friendly creature within 60ft of the cloak can expend one sanity point to re-roll any dice that directly impacts oneself.

### Congealed Paradox
***Northern origin, required attunement***

These thumb-sized black gemstones are mildly painful to touch or look at, as each one contains an impossible duality that has been forcibly reconciled by ancient sorcery. When gripped and broken as a Main Action, the released paradox draws the immediate repression of the Legacy as mundane reality is violently reinforced in the surrounding 20 feet. Within that radius all active magic or psionic powers are immediately dispelled and no further power use can be performed inside it for the rest of the scene. Only celestial powers are immune to the paradox. Creatures reliant on magic or psionics for existence take 5d6 damage for each full round they spend inside this radius. Every usage requires a sanity check for those who observe the effects, 1d6 sanity cost if fail.

**History**
- Widely known item, Arcane check DC 8/15.
- Created by a mad scholar from the Fifth Dynasty (a northern empire), based on celestial technology, 300 years ago.
- The artefact was created by accident, and the scholar went mad.
