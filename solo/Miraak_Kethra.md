# Travel to Gulthas

![](https://i.imgur.com/bZ1Qptm.png)


[wyvern](../npcs/wyvern.md) and [kethra](../npcs/kethra.md) leave the [holzanderCastle](../locations/holzanderCastle.md). They carry enough resources for a week for both, and are both unharmed.

| Character | Resource          | Clock |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| Kethra    | Supply            | 7   |
| Miraak    | Supply            | 7   |
| World     | Encounter         | 0/6   |
| World     | Travel to Road    | 0/6   |
| World     | Travel to Eyaram  | 0/4   |
| World     | Travel to Gulthas | 0/4   |

It is a known path in the desert (rank dangerous, progress 4 hexes).  `Kethra rolls +Wit: 10 for S+`. They choose prolific foraging and efficient planning. The first night goes well. The second day of travel `Kethra rolls +Wit: 13 for S+`. They choose the same as the day before. The second night goes well. The third day of travel is a known road in the desert (rank troublesome, progress 5 hexes). `Kethra rolls +Wit: 7 for S-` and they arrive in Eyaram. It was a very uneventful trip, like all successful trips are.

| Character | Resource          | Clock |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| Kethra    | Supply            | 7   |
| Miraak    | Supply            | 7   |
| World     | Encounter         | 1/6   |
| World     | Travel to Road    | 6/6   |
| World     | Travel to Eyaram  | 2/4   |
| World     | Travel to Gulthas | 0/4   |

For the mood in Eyaram I will get 2 Tarot cards:

- **2 of skulls (FORGETFULNESS)**: Situation - traumatic event / manipulated minds of the city.
- **8 of hourglass (CROSSROAD)**: Individual - Woman running from her past, as she supported the Mercians: [Eleni](../npcs/Eleni.md)

[Marcus](../npcs/Marcus.md) is stationary in [eyaram](../locations/eyaram.md). The entire city had their mind manipulated by the [ngar-tho](../../_gm/statblocks/ngar-tho.md).

For perceiving the psionic power in the city `Kethra rolls +Will -5 (Will Ngar'tho): 9 for S-`. Kethra can perceive strange buildings in the village that make no physical sense, but the encounter clock increases in 1. The reality around the city is being warped by the Ngar'tho. Kethra and Miraak must make a Will Save. `Kethra rolls 1d20 +Will to beat 15: 5 for F` and gets a SS. `Miraak rolls 1d20 +Will to beat 15: 22 for S+`.

| Character | Resource          | Clock |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| Kethra    | Supply            | 7   |
| Kethra    | SS                | 1     |
| Miraak    | Supply            | 7   |
| World     | Encounter         | 2/6   |
| World     | Travel to Gulthas | 0/4   |

In the tavern, they eat some of their supplies in their rooms and sleep. They want to go unnoticed in the city, so they skip breakfast and leave early. `Kethra (the lowest in Wit) rolls +Will: 12 for S+`. They are able to leave the city completely unnoticed.

The travel to Gulthas should be short, and hopefully uneventful. `Kethra rolls +Wit: 6 for F`. They arrive in the canyon and find [Gulthas](../npcs/Gulthas.md). When they shake hands Kethra, who was shaken by the visions in [eyaram](../locations/eyaram.md), suddenly has a dèja-vu. The dèja-vu comes with a feeling, for which I will get 1 Tarot card:

- **Yesod** (major arcana): Principle of Avarice.

Kethra felt that Gulthas had a superiority feeling, as if he came from a more pure species, and because he was part of a clan before. This feeling is artificial, but Kethra feels it real.  `Kethra rolls 1d20 +Will to beat 15: 19 for S+`. Luckly her feelings do not impact her relationship with Gulthas.

| Character | Resource  | Clock |
| --------- | --------- | ----- |
| Kethra    | Supply    | 5     |
| Kethra    | SS        | 0     |
| Miraak    | Supply    | 5     |
| Miraak    | SS        | 0     |
| World     | Encounter | 5/6   |

After finding their ally, as agreed before, they depart for Mystra's temple to find the shaft to the Ammuinoth. I will roll a 1d6 for Gulthas supply and 1d4 for his SS.

| Character | Resource  | Clock |
| --------- | --------- | ----- |
| Kethra    | Supply    | 5     |
| Kethra    | Dmg/SS    | 0/0   |
| Miraak    | Supply    | 5     |
| Miraak    | Dmg/SS    | 0/0   |
| Gulthas   | Supply    | 6     |
| Gulthas   | Dmg/SS    | 0/2   |
| World     | Encounter | 5/6   |
