[wyvern](../npcs/wyvern.md) and [kethra](../npcs/kethra.md) leave the [holzanderCastle](../locations/holzanderCastle.md). They carry enough resources for a week for both, and are both unharmed.

| Kethra    | Supply            | 7   |

| World     | Travel to Gulthas | 0/4   |

It is a known path in the desert (rank dangerous, progress 4 hexes).  `Kethra rolls +Wit: 10 for S+`. They choose prolific foraging and efficient planning. The first night goes well. The second day of travel `Kethra rolls +Wit: 13 for S+`. They choose the same as the day before. The second night goes well. The third day of travel is a known road in the desert (rank troublesome, progress 5 hexes). `Kethra rolls +Wit: 7 for S-` and they arrive in Eyaram. It was a very uneventful trip, like all successful trips are.

| Kethra    | Supply            | 7   |

| World     | Travel to Gulthas | 0/4   |

For the mood in Eyaram I will get 2 Tarot cards:

- **2 of skulls (FORGETFULNESS)**: Situation - traumatic event / manipulated minds of the city.
- **8 of hourglass (CROSSROAD)**: Individual - Woman running from her past, as she supported the Mercians: [Eleni](../npcs/Eleni.md)

[Marcus](../npcs/Marcus.md) is stationary in [eyaram](../locations/eyaram.md). The entire city had their mind manipulated by the [ngar-tho](../../_gm/statblocks/ngar-tho.md).

For perceiving the psionic power in the city `Kethra rolls +Will -5 (Will Ngar'tho): 9 for S-`. Kethra can perceive strange buildings in the village that make no physical sense, but the encounter clock increases in 1. The reality around the city is being warped by the Ngar'tho. Kethra and Miraak must make a Will Save. `Kethra rolls 1d20 +Will to beat 15: 5 for F` and gets a SS. `Miraak rolls 1d20 +Will to beat 15: 22 for S+`.

| Character | Resource          | Clock |

| Kethra    | Supply            | 7   |
| Kethra    | SS                | 1     |

| World     | Encounter         | 2/6   |
| World     | Travel to Gulthas | 0/4   |

In the tavern, they eat some of their supplies in their rooms and sleep. They want to go unnoticed in the city, so they skip breakfast and leave early. `Kethra (the lowest in Wit) rolls +Will: 12 for S+`. They are able to leave the city completely unnoticed.

The travel to Gulthas should be short, and hopefully uneventful. `Kethra rolls +Wit: 6 for F`. They arrive in the canyon and find [Gulthas](../npcs/Gulthas.md). When they shake hands Kethra, who was shaken by the visions in [eyaram](../locations/eyaram.md), suddenly has a dèja-vu. The dèja-vu comes with a feeling, for which I will get 1 Tarot card:

- **Yesod** (major arcana): Principle of Avarice.

Kethra felt that Gulthas had a superiority feeling, as if he came from a more pure species, and because he was part of a clan before. This feeling is artificial, but Kethra feels it real.  `Kethra rolls 1d20 +Will to beat 15: 19 for S+`. Luckly her feelings do not impact her relationship with Gulthas.

| Miraak    | SS        | 0     |
| World     | Encounter | 5/6   |

After finding their ally, as agreed before, they depart for Mystra's temple to find the shaft to the Ammuinoth. I will roll a 1d6 for Gulthas supply and 1d4 for his SS.

# Travel to Weldon
***Date 3877.6D5***

From the canyons, the group decided to travel by road until close to Gimorkoc, but leaving the road before arriving in the city, and then travelling through the desert towards Mystra's Temple. Through the known road (rank troublesome, progress 5 hexes) `Kethra rolls +Wit: 4 for F`. An encounter clock is filled and the group expend supply, they progress only 2 hexes. I will take 4 tarot cards for the encounter.

| Character | Resource  | Clock |

| Kethra    | Supply    | 4     |
| Kethra    | Dmg-SS    | 0-0   |
| Miraak    | Supply    | 4     |
| Miraak    | Dmg-SS    | 0-0   | 
| Gulthas   | Supply    | 5     |
| Gulthas   | Dmg-SS    | 0-2   |
| World     | Encounter | 2/6   |

- Level: 1 of skull - Metropolis - Angels of the Heavenly Choirs
- Effect: 3 of skull - Remnants - Broken angel, from a fallen Supraxis.
- Reaction: 2 of roses - Birth? of a golem
- Weakness - 2 of crescent - Creation
- Tipharet

Reading: A sole survivor angel golem (an experiment to fight the Turnskull constructs), from a fallen Supraxis, after a Turnskull attack (level 1 left). The angel golem is very aggressive. The golem is beautifully depraved and mis-constructed.

Kethra feels sorry for the creature and gets close to the golem, showing she means no harm `Kethra rolls +Will -4 (for reaction): 7 for S-`. The golem sees the party and, for a split second, it seemed it would not attack. However it quickly decides to run in fear.

The group continues on the road on the following day `Kethra rolls +Wit: 7 for S-`.  The group luckily finds good foraging, avoiding consuming their current supplies. The night's rest was not very comfortable but the group is very close to Gimorkoc now.

On the following day they turn south towards Mystra's temple. It is a know desert route (rank dangerous, progress 4 hexes) `Kethra rolls +Wit: 12 for S+`. The group find a hidden stash of desert wine buried close to one of the ruins. After a quick forage for herbs and small animals, the group have a relaxing evening drinking around the fire and telling stories. They are ready to arrive in Mystra's temple.

| Character | Resource  | Clock |

| Kethra    | Dmg-SS    | 0-0   |

| Miraak    | Dmg-SS    | 0-0   | 
| Gulthas   | Supply    | 5     |
| Gulthas   | Dmg-SS    | 0-1   |
| World     | Encounter | 4/6   |

Kethra introduces her travelling party `Kethra rolls +Will: 14 for S+`. The group is well received in the temple. One of the priests remembers Miraak and Kethra's friendship with Amyria and offers them hospitality. While eating, Miraak ends up meeting an adventurer that just travelled to the mountains, and he shares that Kathadzig is well populated by the dwarves again - but they something meaner in their temper.

On the next day, the group departs early to find the shaft towards the Ardismouth temple `Kethra rolls +Will: 12 for S+` and finds it in a couple of hours of search. The three broken heroes go into the temple tower and climb it down to progress the rest of their journey in the tunnels of the Ammuinoth `Kethra rolls +Will: 12 for S+`. They remember exactly how to stay safe in the tunnels and travel very silently (_Formidable_ journey, *known* path: 3 hexes/progress). The group is also lucky to find wild mushrooms and have enough light through a broken wall to plan the next day.

After waking up, the group is quickly travelling through the tunnels again `Kethra rolls +Will +1: 16 for S+`. Their lucky continues strong, and they find again good forage and spend time planning for the next day. For the third day, the group is going to try their luck, but travelling very fast to arrive in one single day to the Castle of Bells, hoping to find Weldon soon `Kethra rolls +Will +1 -4: 10 for S+`.

Upon arrival in the Castle of Bells, they are lucky to find Weldon in a good mood. The heroes explain their goal to take down Ghuse, and Kethra discusses with Weldon the possibility of him joining the fray `Kethra rolls +Will: 11 for S+`. Weldon is aware of all the bad that Ghuse has been doing in the mountain - effectively turning it into an industrial site to exploit the war that is about to start between the Acrisae and Turnskull.

# Securing the upper hand

**Current force in Glasrath**

- **Ghuse's** 2000 undead - all working in the mines
	- 2 Vast Mobs of 30 HD (500 each)
	- 6 Large Mobs of 20 HD (100 each)
	- 20 Small Mobs of 10 HD (20 each)
- **Ghuse's** 120 loyal soldiers (humans and drows)
	- 4 Small Mobs of 12 HD (20 each) stationary in Khathadzig
	- 2 Small Mobs of 12 HD (20 each) working in the mines
- **Resistance's** 80 dwarves
	- 2 Small Mobs of 12 HD (20 each) working in Khathadzig
	- 2 Small Mobs of 12 HD (20 each) doing slave labour in the mines

What is happening is Glasrath (tarot):

- **1 Main**: Discord
- **2 Past**: 4/Roses Growth - Gain power and expand. An idea grows into an obsession, desire. Cancer.
- **3 Next**: 5/Eyes Division - Rally, Arson, Heated debates.
- **4 Weakness**: 5/Roses Predator - Stalking, ambush and hidden motifs.
- **5 Strength**: 1/Roses Gaia - Stronger kills the weaker, loosing control, a body that changes.

**Reading**: While Ghuse transforms Glasrath in an industrial scale production site, the resistance grows stronger. The dwarves were made aware of the presence of Weldon, the Werebear, in the Castle of Bells. They have been rallying Weldon to join forces with them, and have been causing troubles to Ghuse's interests. Ghuse becomes afraid of the situation and start dealing with the population in his dread dragon form. All is set for the resistance's execution to take down Ghuse and the undead.

When the group arrives and meet Weldon, they are made aware of the current situation. Their approach is to make contact with the Dwarves in Khatadzig and, from there, launch small forces to free the enslaved Dwarves in the mine.
