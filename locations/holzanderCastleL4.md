# Castle of Holzander Level 4

Level 4 is Imortra, in her work with the Ngar'tho, supported by Mercians and Antinom, performing all kinds of radical experiments. A cult-experiment created by Imortra also resides in the level, they do not create much problem and can be used for further experimentation. Most of the cult believers are of Derrors - weak-bred dwarves mixed with Antinom, but they never matured properly. A few years ago a group severed from the group and now live in a small cave village.

## General

### Suppressed memories (Ravenloft 65)
***When characters fail sanity tests on level 4***

## Factions
### Cult of Camazotz

The first cult created by [imortra](arrival/npcs/imortra.md), but abandoned by her. Camazotz is the god the cult idolize. Their image is similar to that of the [ngar-tho](_gm/npcCodex/statblocks/ngar-tho.md) (show picture of frozen Ngar'tho).

- Derros: Weak bread of dwarves, without the Dwarf pure-blood required to manipulate the legacy. They are not very intelligent in general - although Gilsfeyr is smart enough, being a mix of Derro and Antinom. They also have tattooed body, but are very pale and do not use ornamented clothing.
- Bats (several types)
- Drakustanz - a mind-enslaved dragonborn

### Village

Derros that long ago left the cult
