# Castle of Holzander Level 4

- [Imortra](arrival/npcs/imortra.md)'s level, where she conducts her experiments guided by the [ngar-tho](_gm/npcCodex/statblocks/ngar-tho.md).
- Also present are Imortra's supporter: [mercians](arrival/factions/mercians.md) and [antinom](_gm/npcCodex/statblocks/antinom.md), performing all kinds of radical experiments.
- A cult-experiment that went wrong, created by Imortra, also resides in the level: they do not create much problem and can be used for further experimentation.
- Most of the cult believers are of Derros - weak-bred dwarves mixed with Antinom, but they never matured properly. A few years ago a group severed from the group and now live in a small cave village.

## Factions

Of the three “political” divisions on this level, only Imortra the Debased is interested in stopping intruders from reaching the next level down where Gellert the Gruesome resides. **The Derros are barely sane at the best of times, and between the derro’s fevered worship of Camazotz and the dangerous fungal extracts they imbibe, these times are less than ideal.** No matter where an individual derro falls on that scale, they all enjoy tormenting and bullying anything weaker than themselves. If given the chance, they gleefully enslave the characters, blind them, torture them to death, and eat their flesh—perhaps not in that order. The bats have a more stable society than the derro.
### Cult of Camazotz

**DERRO ARE ALL WEAK AND NUTS**

The first cult created by [imortra](arrival/npcs/imortra.md), but abandoned by her. Camazotz is the god the cult idolize. Their image is a mix of the [ngar-tho](_gm/npcCodex/statblocks/ngar-tho.md) and a giant bat.

**Derros: Weak bread of dwarves, without the Dwarf pure-blood required to manipulate the legacy.** They are not very intelligent in general - although Gilsfeyr is smart enough, being a mix of Derro and Antinom. They also have tattooed body, but are very pale and do not use ornamented clothing.

### Derro Village

**DERRO ARE ALL WEAK AND NUTS**

Kurgorom, a derro witch queen, and her loyalists who’ve grown tired of chanting endlessly to bats through a haze of soporific smoke and prefer traditional derro pursuits such as raiding the surface, tormenting captives, and brewing dangerous fungal extracts.

Kurgorom wants to partner with Gilsfeyr until Imortra is taken down, from there she intends to raid the cultists.
