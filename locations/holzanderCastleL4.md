# Castle of Holzander Level 4

## Cult of Camazotz

The first cult created by [imortra](arrival/npcs/imortra.md), but abandoned by her. Camazotz is the god the cult idolize. Their image is similar to that of the [ngar-tho](_gm/npcCodex/statblocks/ngar-tho.md) (show picture of frozen Ngar'tho).

- Derros: Weak bread of dwarves, without the Dwarf pure-blood required to manipulate the legacy. They are not very intelligent in general - although Gilsfeyr is smart enough, being a mix of Derro and Antinom. They also have tattooed body, but are very pale and do not use ornamented clothing.
- Bats (several types)
- Drakustanz - a mind-enslaved dragonborn
