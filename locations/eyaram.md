# Fort City of Eyaram
***Old desert fort city***

- **Type**: Community
- **Power structure**: A community organisation led by majority rule, in which decisions are made by an elected council. (Democratic)
- **Major actors**
	- **Crema** (N), the **local female [soldier](https://open5e.com/monsters/soldier-a5e) leader of the [FFKA East]factions/ffkaEast.md)**.
		- Knows the military of the FFKA is needed in the city.
		- Has close connection with [Sergarus](arrival/npcs/Sergarus.md) (who is always travelling the posts).
		- Crema is wretched in appearance, with short silver hair and bright blue eyes. She wears simple clothing and a wooden holy symbol. Crema is savage but creative.
	- **Olal** (LE), an **[FFKA East]factions/ffkaEast.md) female [Knight](https://open5e.com/monsters/knight)**
		- Remarkably beautiful and persuasive.
		- Olal has auburn hair and light green eyes. She wears banded mail and wields a military pick and shield. Olal seeks revenge against the sister who betrayed him.
	- [Eleni](arrival/npcs/Eleni.md), a **rich merchant** [commoner](https://open5e.com/monsters/commoner)
- **Minor actors**
	- **Arwel** (NG), a female dwarf innkeeper, supported by the [Rurkinar]factions/rurkinar.md).
		- Arwel has straight copper hair and blue eyes. She wears plain clothing and a yellow cloak. Arwel has an animal companion, a grey rat named Adrieldas.
	- **Galadan** (N), retired [FFKA East]factions/ffkaEast.md) cleric.
		- Galadan has tangled white hair and grey eyes. He wears well-made clothing and wields a dagger and darts. Galadan is vulgar and decisive.
- **Temperament**: The community court **is dislocated, recently forced to move or give up land**.
- **Conflicts**: There is conflict over **the very restricted crops being produced**, which are being depleted fast with the sheer number of FFKA members stationed in the city.
- **Defences**: If threatened with destruction, the court is defended by **a secret cult with potent magic**.
- **Consequence of its destruction**: If the court is dissolved, **a dark power will recruit the survivors**.

**City was sieged by undead in 3877.6F5 and sits in ruins now.**

## Locations

- A Rurkinar temple converted into a Faletist church.
	- Temple has subterranean access to depths below. The access is locked, FFKA leader has the key.
- [Eleni](arrival/npcs/Eleni.md)'s modest (but well geared) trade shop, built around a large tree - it is a secret Rurkinar meeting place.
- The Cursed Spear: A modest [tavern](https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/inn/), built close to the fortress in a brick house.
-  A Mercian house outside the city: [Joorn](arrival/npcs/Joorn.md) is there
