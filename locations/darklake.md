# Darklake

You found on an old scripture that the lake is controlled by the Cultists of Cuncharn, which is a minor deity under Algath (god that Ghuse follows). The symbol of Cuncharn is the same as the one Ghuse uses (and you found in Nilperto, and the red dragon had - according to the Nargun).

The lake is controlled by the Cultists of [Curcharn, the Boatman and Spirit of the Darklake]context/religions.md#Curcharn), which is a minor deity under [Algath, Goddess of Life and Death]context/religions.md#Algath). The symbol of Cuncharn is the same as the one Ghuse uses (and you found in Nilperto, and the red dragon had - according to the Nargun).
