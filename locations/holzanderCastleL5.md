Although it has many similarities to a ghost, the ghostly foe is not undead. It’s an alien aberration from the Void that took up residence in the stones.

A ghostly foe is a terrifying entity.  It isn’t a creature in the normal sense of that word; it’s a consciousness that resides inside massive stones near powerful magical resonance, usually in the vicinity of a ley line or the terminus  
of a shadow road. When sentient creatures are nearby, the consciousness manifests as ghostly warriors that attack the intruders. The number of warriors can vary. Often it matches the number of intruders one-for-one, but not always. No matter how many manifestations there are, they all spring from the same consciousness. The manifestations are tough but can be destroyed.

```encounter
creatures:
  - 2d4-2: [HD 05, Ghostly manifestations]
```
**Deadly Possession:** WIS/CHA save DC 15 every turn. If successful: creature are controlled by the Ghostly foe. If failed (a fail can be chosen) full control of life is given to the Ghostly foe, but the creature will be petrified. A petrified creature is restored to its normal state by greater restoration, dispel evil and good, or comparable magic. While petrified, the creature must make a death saving throw every 10 days. A success or a natural 20 has no effect, but the creature dies after three failures.

### 505

Xymargshra isn’t interested in negotiating with the characters, but it will of course deliver a monologue during battle (in its harsh voice sprinkled with the impossible vowels and consonants of Void Speech) describing its utter disdain for lesser life forms and the certainty of its victory.

```encounter
creatures:
  - 1: Cursed Spider
  - 2d4-2: Phase Spider
```
### 507

Initially, the fate eaters coiled around the golem are merely curious about the characters. They communicate via telepathy, and they frequently “speak” in harmonic unison or complete each other’s sentences. Their telepathic communication makes it impossible for characters to determine which one is “speaking.” If characters ask the worms to name themselves or identify which is communicating, they don’t understand the question. Eventually they make a remark about the “quaint human custom of pretending to be individuals somehow distinct from, and superior to, all other entities in the Weave." **They can discern facts about someone’s past and trends about their future the characters might find interesting or alarming.**

Roleplay the fate eaters as [Sauron's mouth](https://youtu.be/To_RJ_mPNqM?si=JQiHh1V-FbGf2yln).

```encounter
creatures:
  - 2: [HD 07, Fate Eater]
```

![|400](https://i.imgur.com/p6QYM17.png)

**_Spectral Bite._** When a fate eater scores a **critical hit against** a target, it damages not only the creature but also the threads of its fate, changing the character’s past or future. The target must roll 1d6 on the chart below for each critical hit that isn’t negated by a successful DC 15 Charisma saving throw:

| d6 roll | Result                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | Seeing the Alternates: Suffers the effects of the confusion spell for 1d4 rounds                                                                                               |
| 2       | Untied from the Loom: Character’s speed is randomized for four rounds. Roll 3d20 at the start of each of the character’s turns to determine his or her speed in feet that turn |
| 3       | Shifting Memories: Permanently loses 2 from a random skill and gains 2 in a random untrained skill                                                                             |
| 4       | Not So Fast: Loses the use of one class ability, chosen at random                                                                                                              |
| 5       | Lost Potential: Loses 1 point from one randomly chosen ability score                                                                                                           |
| 6       | Took the Lesser Path: The character’s current hit point total becomes his or her hit point maximum                                                                             |

**Effects 3-6 are permanent** until the character makes a successful Charisma saving throw. The saving throw is repeated after every long rest, but the **DC increases by 1** after every long rest, as the character becomes more entrenched in this new destiny. Otherwise, these new fates can be undone by nothing short of a wish spell or comparable magic.

### 509/510

```encounter
creatures:
  - 2d4-1: [HD 04, Deep One]
```

![|400](https://i.imgur.com/RUevdrw.png)

**_Voice of the Deeps._** A deep one may sway an audience of listeners with its rolling, droning speech, fascinating them for 5 minutes and making them dismiss or forget what they’ve seen recently unless they make a successful DC 13 Wisdom saving throw at the end of that period. If the saving throw succeeds, they remember whatever events the deep one sought to erase.

### 511

```encounter
creatures:
  - 1: [HD 20, Shadow River Lord Arch Necromancer]
  - 1d4: [HD 02, Shadow Skelleton]
```
### 513/514

```encounter
creatures:
  - 1: [HD 16, Blood Hag]
  - 1: [HD 08, Crimsom Mist]
```

**Blood Hag**
- **Blood-Drinking Hair**. The hag drains blood from one creature [grappled](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Grappled) by her. The target must make a DC 17 [Constitution](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Constitution) saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The blood hag regains [hp](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) equal to half the necrotic damage taken.
- **Face Peel**. The blood hag peels the face off one creature [grappled](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Grappled) by her. The target must succeed on a DC 17 [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) saving throw or take 14 (4d6) slashing damage and be [stunned](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Stunned) until the end of its next turn. The target’s [hp](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. While its [hp](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) maximum is reduced in this way, the target has disadvantage on all [Charisma](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Charisma) checks. The target dies if this effect reduces its [hp](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) maximum to 0.
- **Sanguine Curse**. The blood hag curses one creature she can see or sense within 60 feet of her. The target must succeed on a DC 17 [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom) saving throw or be cursed for 1 minute. A creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw if it doesn’t have blood. While cursed, the target is [incapacitated](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Incapacitated) and takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns as its internal blood vessels rupture. The cursed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the curse on itself on a success. The blood hag can have only one target cursed at a time. If it curses another, the effect on the previous target ends.

**Crimsom Mist**
- **Pseudocorporeal**. The crimson mist is weightless and can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing.
- **Sanguine Feast**. Whenever the crimson mist deals necrotic damage to a living creature with blood in its body, the creature’s [hp](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) maximum is reduced by the same amount and the mist regains [hp](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) equal to half the necrotic damage dealt. The reduction lasts until the creature finishes a [long rest](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/the-environment/#Long_Rest). The creature dies if this effect reduces its [hp](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points) maximum to 0.
- **Engulf**. The mist moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter a Medium or smaller creature’s space. When the mist enters a creature’s space, the creature must make a DC 15 [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the mist. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw. On a failed save, the mist enters the creature’s space, and the creature takes 15 (4d6) necrotic damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can’t breathe, is [restrained](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Restrained), and takes 15 (4d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the mist’s turns. When the mist moves, the engulfed creature doesn’t move with it, and is freed. An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 14 [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the mist. A creature within 5 feet of the mist can take an action to pull a creature out of the mist. Doing so requires a DC 14 [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) check, and the creature making the attempt takes 14 (4d6) necrotic damage. The mist can only engulf one Medium or smaller creature at a time.

```encounter
name: 522
creatures:
  - [HD 16, Drowned Maiden]
```

- **Hair**. _Melee Weapon Attack_: +6 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. _Hit_: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage, and the target is [grappled](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Grappled) (escape DC 16) if it is a Large or smaller creature. She can grapple up to three creatures at a time. The hair holding a creature can be attacked and destroyed (AC 15; 15 [hp](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points); immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage).
- **Draining Kiss**. One creature within 5 feet of the maiden and that she is grappling must make a DC 15 [Charisma](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Charisma) saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage, and its [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) is reduced by 1d6. On a success, the target takes half the damage, and its [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) isn’t reduced. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its [Strength](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Strength) is reduced to 0.
- **Illusory Appearance**. The maiden covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general [size](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Creature-Size) and Humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the maiden takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 15 [Intelligence](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence) ([Investigation](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#Investigation)) check to discern that the maiden is disguised.

### 524 nighmare

```encounter
creatures:
  - 4: [HD 04, Deep One]
  - [HD 20, Shoggoth]
```

- **Absorb Flesh**. When the shoggoth kills a creature while within 15 feet of it, the creature’s body is absorbed into the shoggoth’s. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a [true resurrection](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/true-resurrection) or a [wish](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/wish) spell.
- **Amorphous**. The shoggoth can move through a space as narrow as 1 foot wide without squeezing.
- **Hideous Cacophony**. The shoggoth’s many mouths constantly emit whistles, fluting, and other high-pitched noises. It has disadvantage on [Dexterity](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity) (Stealth) checks made to be unheard. Each creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the shoggoth and that can hear it must make a DC 19 [Wisdom](https://www.5esrd.com/using-ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom) saving throw or be disoriented until the start of its next turn. A disoriented creature is [incapacitated](https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/conditions/#Incapacitated), and when it moves, it moves in a random direction. Unless surprised, a creature can cover its ears to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t hear until the start of its next turn, when it can cover its ears again. If the creature uncovers its ears in the meantime while within 60 feet of the shoggoth, it must immediately make the save. A creature that is covering its ears and that has access to cloth, wax, or similar material can stuff its ears with the material as a bonus action to free up its hands, deafening itself while the material remains stuffed in its ears.

### 524 The Void

- the room is much larger than what is in the map, 1d4+4 Ngar'tho attending to vampiric evourecs that are then attached to undead bodies to create Lady Scurvy who are then thrown in the river.
- Kimbarak **golden dagger** is found on Dolmans hand, and Mr Void asks Dolman to open a rift in the legacy by sacrificing Guilf while the Ngar'tho hold Amyria.
- Present dolman with a dark gift after a rest
- The Ngar'tho tells the PCs they need to release Thalia first, unless Amyria's body is used in the ritual if she dies.
- **The ritual can be completed even with any of the PCs dead**
- **The Void being incarnate he is afraid**
