## City summary

- **One liner**s
	- Rustic, self-determined earnestness and unremarkable logging settlement (oak, ash, and rowan)
	- Very wet oasis for the region (middle of the estepes)
	- Wood palisade surrounds most of the town with platforms and small watchtowers attached to the palisade at each entrance
	- FFKA is entrenched in every aspect of the city life, making sure no adventurers are going to the Holzander Castle
- **Religion**: Strong presence of Faletism, declining presence of Rurkinar
- **Culture**: Mercian
- **Races**: Half of the population is human, the other half of mixed desert races

## Organisation

- Government: Mayor Wislaw Broz leads Redtower by virtue of being supported by the town’s most notable and wealthy citizens.
- Defense: Constable Roch heads Redtower’s law enforcement and defense with a small militia of 20 volunteers and the battlemage Kondrad of Runkelstad in reserve.
- Commerce: Redtower’s primary export is lumber, but it sustains itself on the patronage of adventurers.
