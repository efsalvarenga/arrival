# Dead Made God
***Cultural site, inscrutable outsider art structure: Cyclical doom & Sealed evil***

**Involucre of an long forgotten made god, that can be used to hold Mondendovil, once it is made free from his prison. Being imprisoned and without a physical body is part of the destruction and empowerment cycle of Mondendovil.**

There’s a phenomenon to the ruin that makes it tremendously dangerous at certain intervals. Fluxes of ancient radiation, swarms of quick-breeding dangerous vermin, withering geomantic conjunctions, or cyclically-awakened preserved inhabitants might make the place exceedingly deadly for intruders there at that time. The natives may or may not know about the cycle, and if it’s a very long one, they might not have been around to see it happen.

The ruin serves as a prison for some terribly dangerous entity or power. It may have been originally designed to serve such a purpose, or retrofitted by later inhabitants due to a sudden need, or possibly even mistaken for some other kind of structure by innocent discoverers of a later era. Something about the evil makes it exceptionally hard to kill or permanently destroy, so imprisoning it “forever” seemed wiser.

- E  Outsider determined to trigger the cycle, Native leader who wants to weaponize it, **Mercian researcher with no care for the consequences**
- F Hereditary warden of the prison
- C The cycle leaves behind a valuable byproduct
- T Key to halt the cycle is seal on the creature that’s an extremely valuable item in itself. Needs theurgy energy to be activated.
- P Walls full of warning iconography made inscrutable by time, with images of past cycle effects
