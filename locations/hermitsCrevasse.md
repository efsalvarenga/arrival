# Hermits' Crevasse
***Extreme example of native terrain: Collapsed deep & Hermitage***

An ancient Deep once was located here, but time caused it to collapse. The location is now a large crater, with the remnants of the deep's entrance. Small sections of the deep can still be accessed, but it is a major collapse risk. A group of hermit bandit group lives in the safest area of the crumbling ruin, but now afraid of the undead. They are lead by [FilarionPapetor](../npcs/FilarionPapetor.md)

- **Enemies**: Disguised Mercian [antinom](../statblocks/antinom.md) living amongst the hermits
- **Friends**: A funny blighted elf (calls himself Thirteen), that knows how to go around the ruins. He is seeking help for the hermits
- **Complications**: Carnivor rats are digging their way up
- **Things**: Thirteen knows of a seraphic engine shard buried in the deep
- **Perils**: Crevasse
