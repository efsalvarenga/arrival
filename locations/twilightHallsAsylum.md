# Twilight Halls Asylum
***Commanding height: Motherlode & Isolated academy***

![](https://i.imgur.com/lZokZrt.png)


A school of ancient technology. The place was once the heart of the ancient city where the academy was founded, but it has been forgotten for millenia. The academy is likely largely self-sufficient but its students and teachers doubtless retain some ties to the outer world. The location was chosen because it provides a rare sand that can power technology devices. The motherlode might be known only to the natives, or is perhaps known to no one at all due to its concealment or exotic nature.

- **Enemy**: The academy serves a Turnskull Sorcerer
- **Friends**:  Sympathetic young student.
- **Complications**: The substance is very hazardous to the extractor.
- **Things**: Acrisae detector, that is being smuggled by [EmanuelWeiss](../npcs/EmanuelWeiss.md)
- **Perils**: Site scorched and blasted by their mistakes or training errors
