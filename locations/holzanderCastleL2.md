The leader (firstblade) of the dust goblin raiding party is a veteran of many such incursions named Keluikinj. Like most dust goblins who rise to positions of leadership  in their tribe, Keluikinj’s mind is twisted and grim. He’s no more sadistic than most dust goblins, but he has a fascination with the Void—or at least with the idea of the Void, as his understanding of the Void’s nature is only a caricature of reality. Based on what he’s seen inside the citadel, Keluikinj believes Cagoth-ze and Danaska Maksilov have a connection to the Void that he’d like to exploit. They don’t, but that belief is what’s stopped the dust goblins so far from finishing what they came here for, which is murder and looting. The other dust goblins in Keluikinj’s group are losing patience with his delays and are on the verge of killing him so they can get on with killing everyone else.

### H206 (CR 7.5)

- [Maksilov]npcs/danaska.md) and Bastron (CR 4)

**Potion of heroism and hill giant strength**. Bastron keeps the small potion vial on a string around its neck. When it looks like a fight is about to break out he drinks **before**.

```encounter
name: Mephits (CR 1.5)
creatures:
 - 1: Danaska Maksilov
 - 1: Ice Mephit
 - 1: Dust Mephit
 - 1: Magma Mephit
 - 1: Steam Mephit
 - 1: Ochre Jelly
```
- Damage Immunities. Add acid.
- Death Burst. A creature that fails its saving throw also takes 3 (1d6) acid damage in addition to the standard effects.
- Innate Spellcasting. The mephit can choose between its listed spell or acid splash (7 [2d6] damage).
- Claws. A hit deals 2 (1d4) acid damage in addition to other listed damage.
- Breath Weapon. The attack deals 5 (2d4) acid damage in addition to other listed damage and effects.

- **On round 2 or 3: Ochre Jelly (CR 2)falls from ceiling and receives [potion of growth](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Enlarge%20Reduce?expansion=0#content)**

### H208 (CR 2)

**Mention an invisible field in the air that somehow seizes onto and discorporates whatever it touches, like some sort of slow-acting stasis or disintegration field.** Active successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot it. Even then, it looks like an out-of-focus disturbance in the air, not a solid object.

When the dire gelatinous cube first starts its turn with **28 or fewer hit points, it reflexively strikes the cracked holding tank as a bonus action. This ruptures the tank and floods the room with ooze plasma**. Every space from the top of the stairs to the door into Area 202 quickly becomes ankle-deep in ooze plasma, making it difficult terrain and dealing (2) 1d4 acid damage to every creature standing in the stuff at the start of their turn. The dire gelatinous cube heals 18 (4d4 + 8) hit points thanks to the infusion of plasma. In addition, every creature in that area when the tank is ruptured must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone as the corrosive plasma envelops their feet. The cube tries to engulf as many prone characters as possible, and prone characters attempt to save against the attack with disadvantage.

Finally, just because the cube is eventually killed doesn’t mean it stops being a threat. **It can still block the passage (invisibly)**, and it’s still powerfully acidic to anyone and anything attempting to climb over it or squeeze through it.

### H211

**Ngar'tho. "We've seen your intellects before :)"**
If PCs save the Ngar'tho - gain recognition by the Ngar'tho hive. If they kill him - the opposite.

creatures:
 - 1: Ngar'tho
