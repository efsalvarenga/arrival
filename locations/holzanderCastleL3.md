# Castle of Holzander Level 3

- The trollkin chief is a reaver named Bjrnyar. Bjrnyar is a veteran of many raids that taught him the value of patience and planning.
- The two other reavers are his lieutenants, Egail and Gostov.
	- Egail is a young hothead who wants only to kill enemies and gain glory.
	- Gostov looks up to Bjrnyar and respects his wisdom but also grows impatient with prolonged inactivity.
- The two shamans are Giydya and Sassigne.
	- Giydya is utterly loyal to Bjrnyar. She would (and has) killed other trollkin to enforce the chieftain’s decrees.
	- Sassigne is a fanatical follower of Thor, but this zealotry is mostly a front to cover up Sassigne’s true devotion to Chernobog, whose rites were banned by Bjrnyar.
