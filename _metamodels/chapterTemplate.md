### Motivations
- **Dolman**: 
- **Miraak**: 
- **Guilf**: 
- **Amyria**: 
- **Kethra**: 


## Intro
- Things to discuss before game starts

## Strong start 
Description of your strong start.  

## Potential scenes 
**Scene name** (outline 6 possible scenes)
- Small scene description, including location and interactive environment (remember: combat is not an encounter, and NPCs don't start combat, PCs do)
- Awareness triggers: what are the earliest moments PCs can become aware of the encounter and what happens if they don't 
- Dramatic question: Every situation needs to have a draw or a threat embedded, with a call to action
- Source of conflicts: Determine source of conflicts (foes, environment) that will drive the conflicting goals and objectives - including internal conflicts and multiple possibilities for ending (DM has to think of a couple)
- What are the NPCs' goals and strategies (tactics are detailed in their statblocks)
- End conditions: Scene ends when the dramatic question is answered, no more conflicts are left or PCs do not have decision points anymore. Combat can end before all foes are killed with theatrical ending when a winning side is clear.
- Scoreboard (if applicable): HP for combat and [progress clocks](https://bladesinthedark.com/progress-clocks) for non-combat
