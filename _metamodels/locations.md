- **Enemies** are antagonists characteristic of the trope. They’re exemplary villains or troublemakers that can be responsible for whatever unhappy situation exists that needs adventurers to help sort it out. They may not be the worst or more dangerous denizens of the place, but they’re vexing enough to make trouble for the natives.
- **Friends** are sympathetic or appealing NPCs that the players might be expected to want to help or coop- erate with. They’re the locals who are most likely to seek out adventurers for help or otherwise provide the hook for getting involved in a situation. The examples provide likely Friends for each tag, but the GM can tweak them to better suit the known interests and inclinations of the players.
- **Complications** are particular twists or difficulties that are characteristic of the trope. They may be partial inversions of the tag, or complexities that it layers onto a situation, or subversions of likely player expectations. Complications are meant to keep problems from being too straightforward and simply resolved without having to deal with the complexities of the place.
- **Things** are macguffins, treasures, rewards, or plun- der that might be found at the site, objects that the Ene- mies or Friends might be fighting over or that might be part of a Complication’s entanglements. While a pile of loot is usually enough to catch the eye of any adventurer, a Thing is something specific to the tag’s theme.
- **Places** are archetypal locations or characteristic structures for the tag, the kind of places you’d expect to adventure in were you in such a place. Other Places can be used as thematic backdrops for an adventure.
