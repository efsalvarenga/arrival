## Linhe

- [ ] Sergarus does not die, but is forever crippled. Marcus takes over.
- [ ] Mercians, primarily human in blood but bearing the weight of forsaken traditions
- [ ] Mercians sought the plane of Makab in the Linhe region: **Desert in the NE of Linhe is turning into a moist mud *Arratu*.**
- [ ] Mercian enigmatic leader, Imortra, possessed a beguiling charm that ensnared the minds and hearts of the cultists, a siren's call leading them deeper into the abyss.
- [ ] A force of Lady Scurvy is set loose to prey on a dispatch of Angels. As the Mercians who set them loose come back, they meet a force or Anaks. The Anaks are told of the Lady Scurvy and use the opportunity to cause further losses to the Angels. The Angels loose most of their Sand Warriors and a few Angels. A Supraxae is captured by the Anaks (but they don't know how to pilot it).
- [ ] FFKA East continues to receive support from their main chapter & the Katho empire, and that is strengthening the partnership with the Acrisae. FFKA East is also using Sand Warriors when necessary.
- [ ] Some Acrisae equipment is starting to fail, but they have not yet realised those are introduced weaknesses by [Bravhar](../npcs/Bravhar.md)
- [ ] The guerrilla/chase of isolated Angels and Sand Warriors continues by Anaks and Lady Scurvy - who are not operating in an alliance, but are taking advantage of the situation.
- [ ] **Ongoing War and Alliance Dynamics**: Katho's war with the D'elsinese Empire continues, straining its military and alliances with neighboring lands like Foucheresia and Romburghia.
- [ ] **Religious and Cultural Tensions in Linhe**: The rise of Faletism and the ongoing zombie invasions in Linhe could intersect with the champions' journey. They might need to assist or evade the Faletist Knights, deal with undead hordes, or exploit these distractions for safe passage.
- [ ] **The Supraxae's Powers and Influence**: The supraxae itself, depending on its abilities and the reverence or fear it inspires, could affect the journey.
- [ ] **The FFKA is sending some tents to recover/protect the Supraxae.**

## The Forge

- [ ] The oil well is drying
- [ ] [EmanuelWeiss](npcs/EmanuelWeiss.md) has encountered an artefact in Gymorcoc that can help inactivate the Supraxae (Epyrean Mundus of high rank), but has still not figured out how to move it to The Forge.

## Holzander

- [ ] Oozes are taking the second level, mixed with undead from the first level. Everything on both levels is getting destroyed: [image](https://i.imgur.com/9ewH6wZ.png)


## Old Terra

- [ ] 12240 kurzgesagt era, Hebrew 6000, the Messiah (Demiurge) came back and gave a breath which sealed off earth from the universe and brought in a lot of peril. This was know as Eschaton, the end of a promise for our species.
