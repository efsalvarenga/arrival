## General

- [ ] Kimbarak Hands are an ancient and powerful artefact - many would be searching for it?

## Linhe

- [ ] FFKA's calvary sieges a Mercian fort in the NE. They attack during the day when the Lady Scurvy and Deepfolk are weakest.
- [ ] The Mercians try to hire mercenary armed guards, but the the reservations that people in Linhe have against them makes it very difficult. None knows what they intend to do with the armed guards.
- [ ] Mercians from the east are reaching out to Glasrath to establish trading routes with them as well - great produce is coming from the mountains who have their strong community now behind the banner of Ghuse.
- [ ] Sergarus does not die, but is forever crippled. Marcus takes over.
- [ ] Mercians, primarily human in blood but bearing the weight of forsaken traditions
- [ ] Mercians sought the plane of Makab in the Linhe region: **Desert in the NE of Linhe is turning into a moist mud *Arratu*.**
- [ ] Mercian enigmatic leader, Imortra, possessed a beguiling charm that ensnared the minds and hearts of the cultists, a siren's call leading them deeper into the abyss.
- [ ] A force of Lady Scurvy is set loose to prey on a dispatch of Angels. As the Mercians who set them loose come back, they meet a force or Anaks. The Anaks are told of the Lady Scurvy and use the opportunity to cause further losses to the Angels. The Angels loose most of their Sand Warriors and a few Angels. A Supraxae is captured by the Anaks (but they don't know how to pilot it).

## The Forge

- [ ] Called Thrain Grunnd in old Kimbarak legends
- [ ] The oil well is drying
- [ ] [EmanuelWeiss](npcs/EmanuelWeiss.md) has encountered an artefact in Gymorcoc that can help inactivate the Supraxae (Epyrean Mundus of high rank), but has still not figured out how to move it to The Forge.

## Holzander

- [ ] Oozes are taking the second level, mixed with undead from the first level. Everything on both levels is getting destroyed.

## Old Terra

- [ ] 2240, Hebrew 6000, the Messiah (Demiurge) came back and gave a breath (Eschaton) which sealed off earth from the universe
