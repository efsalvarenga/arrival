## General

- [ ] Kimbarak Hands are an ancient and powerful artefact - many would be searching for it?
- [ ] Anaks come from D'Elsin and the non-evil have been pushed north by the forces of Turnskull advancing

## Holzander Castle

- [ ] Below level 3 are the unconstructed caverns of the Ghost Domain, now territory of a cult - where a dark river flows.
- [ ] Logic and reason start to break down the lower you go into the scarlet citadel.
- [ ] Many vaults and tombs exist in the lower levels of the Scarlet Citadel filled with untouched artefacts and treasures.
- [ ] There is a tributary of the Black River Styx traveling thorugh the eastern part of the Clacking Caverns.
- [ ] **The 3rd level includes a bunch of tombs left alone by the Deepfolk . They’re scary.**
- [ ] Gellert is trying to draw so much power that he’s almost certainly going to rip the ley lines apart if left unchecked.
- [ ] **Factions of Derro war with one another in the lower levels.**
- [ ] The Deepfolk hate Imorta but fear her and what they’re doing down there.
- [ ] Imortra used the power of the brezal paths to summon all sorts of horrible entities from the void, which now roam in the lower reaches.
- [ ] Imortra tried to use Galiera for a ritual, but somehow it fumbled. She is either dead or kept alive with the other prisoners for the experiments.
- [ ] The Black River has flown down here beneath the lands far longer than any of the construction built below. It was this initial ley-line / shadow river that began the Holzander’s quest for power.
- [ ] Derro are the product of a cult-experiment of Imortra
- [ ] PCs can find a resting place somewhere in L3, once they are not fighting the Deep Folk anymore. Over time undead and oozes will take over though.
- [ ] Creatures tied to the Platform and Sphere devices below are as old as the castle itself.
- [ ] There is a tributary of the Black River Styx traveling through the eastern part of the Clacking Caverns. It’s current is chaotic and unpredictable. One must travel the lower river to reach up to the upper tributary, not the other way. It’s a one-way tributary from the lower river to the upper river.
- [ ] Two factions of Derro battle for supremacy in the bat caves. Neither side is strong enough to defeat the other.
- [ ] The Camazotz cultists under Gilsfeyr think their non-worshiping cousins are heretics
- [ ] The fungus-growers under Kurgorom think the bat cultists are maniacs who’ll be torn apart and eaten by their beloved bats eventually
- [ ] A derro speaker to the darkness (Creature Codex) named Gilsfeyr led his band of outcasts along the Black River until they found this cavern and its population of giant vampire bats, saber-toothed bats, bat swarms, and flame eater swarms. Recognizing a sign from Camazotz when he saw one, Gilsfeyr declared this spot to be their new home. The derro built a small village, constructed a temple, and set about establishing dominance over the bats and raiding the surface for slaves.
- [ ] Kurgorom, a derro witch queen (Creature Codex), and her loyalists who’ve grown tired of chanting endlessly to bats through a haze of soporific smoke and prefer traditional derro pursuits such as raiding the surface, tormenting captives, and brewing dangerous fungal extracts.
- [ ] The derro brew potions of augmented reality that allow them to see this alternate dimension
- [ ] Many areas of L4 exist in **mundus** and **metadimensional** realities at the same time.

## Linhe

- [ ] Sandman warriors: champions of the Angels
- [ ] Mercians from the east are reaching out to Glasrath to establish trading routes with them as well - great produce is coming from the mountains who have their strong community now behind the banner of Ghuse.
- [ ] Hermit's Crevasse is a ruined deep construction, now inhabited by Rurkinar Hermits. They are good people.
- [ ] The camp close to the canyon is protecting people against the stronger undead attacks of recent days. How?

## Mercians

- [ ] Mercians, primarily human in blood but bearing the weight of forsaken traditions
- [ ] they danced upon the graves of ancient gods, their souls divorced from their religious lineage. Their oral tradition wove narratives of forgotten heroes, fantastical creatures, and inscrutable gods who had lost their lustre in the passage of ages. Music and dance, once sacred rites, now became a medium through which they celebrated what little remained of their elusive heritage. Runes, etched in the very fabric of their culture, bore the weight of divination and arcane mastery. 
- [ ] Imortra, a seeker of arcane secrets and mysteries, had delved into the abyssal wisdom of [Ethux'zhurh](campaign/arrival/context/religions.md#Ethux'zhurh), a knowledge acquired through the enigmatic scholar [Gellert Holzander](campaign/arrival/npcs/gellert.md). 
- [ ] As they sought the plane of Makab in the Linhe region
- [ ] they concealed their sinister machinations by weaving their communications into the very fabric of the Ngar'tho's telepathic web, a sinister dance of whispers and hidden secrets that forever bound them to the Ngar'tho's watchful eye. 
- [ ] Their enigmatic leader, Imortra, possessed a beguiling charm that ensnared the minds and hearts of the cultists, a siren's call leading them deeper into the abyss.
- [ ] Their clandestine gatherings unfolded in remote, forsaken sites, far removed from the watchful eyes of civilisation. In their pursuit of control and influence, the cult wielded the nefarious powers bestowed upon them by the Ngar'tho, a sinister arsenal of mind-bending abilities that would shake the very foundations of reality itself.
- [ ] Being incarnate The Void is afraid. As he grew in malice his power passed into the creatures of evil and he become more earth bound - The Void situation is the same as god-brain torment Ravenloft 74
- [ ] Most Ngar'tho are trying to save the void, but some wants to put it out of its misery

## Glasrath

- [ ] **Glasrath: number of undead greatly surpasses the number of alive people (2-to-1), mostly working the mines. Singlestrike joins support for Ghuse and population is mostly in full support (about 200 soldiers and guards are supporting). If characters haven't noticed yet, they notice now, that people are looking more pale and seem a bit brain drained.**
