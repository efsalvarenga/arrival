## General

- [ ] Kimbarak Hands are an ancient and powerful artefact - many would be searching for it?
- [ ] Anaks come from D'Elsin and the non-evil have been pushed north by the forces of Turnskull advancing

## Holzander Castle

- [ ] Creatures tied to the Platform and Sphere devices below are as old as the castle itself.
- [x] There is a tributary of the Black River Styx traveling through the eastern part of the Clacking Caverns. It’s current is chaotic and unpredictable. One must travel the lower river to reach up to the upper tributary, not the other way. It’s a one-way tributary from the lower river to the upper river.
- [x] Many areas of L4 exist in **mundus** and **metadimensional** realities at the same time.

## Linhe

- [ ] Sandman warriors: champions of the Angels
- [ ] Mercians from the east are reaching out to Glasrath to establish trading routes with them as well - great produce is coming from the mountains who have their strong community now behind the banner of Ghuse.
- [ ] Hermit's Crevasse is a ruined deep construction, now inhabited by Rurkinar Hermits. They are good people.
- [ ] The camp close to the canyon is protecting people against the stronger undead attacks of recent days. How?
- [ ] Kiranu and Nurderad cannot take Glasrath down, the dwarves have settled Durnum and the Nurderad had come home to prepare defences for a possible Turnskull attack.
- [ ] Sergarus does not die, but is forever crippled. Marcus takes over.

## Mercians

- [ ] Mercians, primarily human in blood but bearing the weight of forsaken traditions
- [ ] they danced upon the graves of ancient gods, their souls divorced from their religious lineage. Their oral tradition wove narratives of forgotten heroes, fantastical creatures, and inscrutable gods who had lost their lustre in the passage of ages. Music and dance, once sacred rites, now became a medium through which they celebrated what little remained of their elusive heritage. Runes, etched in the very fabric of their culture, bore the weight of divination and arcane mastery. 
- [ ] Imortra, a seeker of arcane secrets and mysteries, had delved into the abyssal wisdom of [Ethux'zhurh](arrival/context/religions.md#Ethux'zhurh), a knowledge acquired through the enigmatic scholar [Gellert Holzander](npcs/Gellert.md). 
- [ ] As they sought the plane of Makab in the Linhe region
- [ ] they concealed their sinister machinations by weaving their communications into the very fabric of the Ngar'tho's telepathic web, a sinister dance of whispers and hidden secrets that forever bound them to the Ngar'tho's watchful eye. 
- [ ] Their enigmatic leader, Imortra, possessed a beguiling charm that ensnared the minds and hearts of the cultists, a siren's call leading them deeper into the abyss.
- [ ] Their clandestine gatherings unfolded in remote, forsaken sites, far removed from the watchful eyes of civilisation. In their pursuit of control and influence, the cult wielded the nefarious powers bestowed upon them by the Ngar'tho, a sinister arsenal of mind-bending abilities that would shake the very foundations of reality itself.
- [ ] Being incarnate The Void is afraid. As he grew in malice his power passed into the creatures of evil and he become more earth bound - The Void situation is the same as god-brain torment Ravenloft 74
- [ ] Most Ngar'tho are trying to save the void, but some wants to put it out of its misery

## Glasrath

- [ ] **Glasrath: number of undead greatly surpasses the number of alive people (2-to-1), mostly working the mines. Singlestrike joins support for Ghuse and population is mostly in full support (about 200 soldiers and guards are supporting). If characters haven't noticed yet, they notice now, that people are looking more pale and seem a bit brain drained.**
- [ ] Miraak, Kethra, Werebear and Nurderad Outcast face Ghuse. They are successful and hurt the faction. Miraak and Kethra are imprisoned, the others are killed.
- [ ] Ushulx arrives in Glasrath
