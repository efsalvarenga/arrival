The D'Elsin people are the Antarctic civilisation under the iron fist rule of ... , an ancient Sorcerer-King. They are known as Turnskull because of the name of the Kingdom's most important castle. Their religion is known as Trow, and one active Made God exists under the castle.

Most of the population are Anaks, but some humans and demi-humans, alongside blighted, are also present. They have an intention to expand towards the North and have their domain covering all the lands south of Glasrath.

They military forces are composed of Turnskull constructs.
