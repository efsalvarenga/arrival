> [!info] Background
> Beneath the surface of the enigmatic Mercian society, in the shifting shadows of forgotten doctrines, a new and sinister current churned—an ominous cult birthed from the marrow of their forsaken religion. This clandestine order, guided [Imortra, the Debased](../npcs/Imortra.md), sought to resurrect the relics of their lost faith, as if rekindling the embers of a long-extinguished pyre.
> 
> Imortra, a seeker of arcane secrets and mysteries, had delved into the abyssal wisdom of [Ethux'zhurh](arrival/context/religions.md#Ethux'zhurh), a knowledge acquired through the enigmatic scholar [Gellert Holzander](../npcs/Gellert.md). In their quest to unravel the esoteric intricacies of the Ngar'tho society, they harnessed this newfound knowledge as a weapon to shape their dark creed. 
> 
> As they sought the plane of Makab in the Linhe region they concealed their sinister machinations by weaving their communications into the very fabric of the Ngar'tho's telepathic web, a sinister dance of whispers and hidden secrets that forever bound them to the Ngar'tho's watchful eye. Within their ranks, the cultists masked their rational minds with a veneer of disturbance, driven by an insatiable craving for the perverse pleasures denied by the laws of decent society. In the throes of fleshly excesses and infernal music rituals, they descended further into the abyss.
> 
> But, amid the chaos, a peculiar devotion bound them together—a sense of familial belonging that transcended the physical realm. Their enigmatic leader, Imortra, possessed a beguiling charm that ensnared the minds and hearts of the cultists, a siren's call leading them deeper into the abyss.
> 
> Their clandestine gatherings unfolded in remote, forsaken sites, far removed from the watchful eyes of civilisation. In their pursuit of control and influence, the cult wielded the nefarious powers bestowed upon them by the Ngar'tho, a sinister arsenal of mind-bending abilities that would shake the very foundations of reality itself.
