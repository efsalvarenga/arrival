# Glasrath Alliance

> [!success] Features, assets
> - **Wealth 4**: Monopoly on mine produce
> - **Force 1**: Thugs - Undead

> [!failure] Troubles
> - Scarcity of resources due to remoteness
> - Population living outside of their normal environments

> [!example] Goals
> - [ ] **Add feature**: create an industrial scale mountain manufacture (mostly for martial purposes) - Wealth 3 Manufactory (cost 8)
> - [ ] **Restore cohesion**: Known people from the first days of the alliance are raised, including the dragon, Fuko and Nilperto - raise all the dead in the mines, and kill civilians to make up an undead army (cost 5: village + minor resistance, impossible). Count of military supporting: 300 (BR 250). Count of undead: 10k (BR 1000). For an average CR 4 (strong soldier Kiranu/Thymar) it will take about 420 of them to face the undead. (cost 4)
> - [ ] **Add feature**: some force asset

> [!info] Background
> After the large battle with the undead, the military units of the cities of Watheton, Gorthugke, Gamunz and Tolfoddund joined forces with the Delmuth people (drows from the Ghost Domain) and the Nargun. They were victorious, but with strong losses.
