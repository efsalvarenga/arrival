# Large Fronts

## Rules

Roll a d20 every time party level reaches a new integer (from 5 onwards), against DC 11. On a success one front advances. Randomly assign which front advances, but the 7th front is always the last - and it should happen at level 20 latest.

## Milestones
***Current fronts: 2/8***

8 more fronts in total
- One kicking off the campaign - the arrival
- 3 each (Acrisae and Turnskull)
- Last: deflagration of full war.

**Turnskull fronts**
