## Geography

> Use these answers to get an idea of the geography. A country famed for its cavalry should have lots of plains and rolling hills. It should have fought most of its battles in this terrain, so any enemy needs to be on the other side of those plains, not coming through a steep mountain pass. A country famed for its ships should have a wide coastline it depends on for its resources. It might have little or no farmland, forcing it to rely on imports to its ports. Two ancient enemies might be separated by a range

> I’d recommend providing much more coast, like Europe. As a Scot I’m biased towards coasts—you can travel coast to coast in my homeland in a couple of hours. But I’m not just saying this out of national pride—coasts allow for more variety in storytelling. You want to create a rich and varied world, so allow it to be rich and varied! Give countries coastlines to defend, straits to battle over, fishing grounds to feed them, and islands that harbor pirates and kraken. Talking of islands—add in groups of islands off the coast.

> Rivers are one of the most important geographical features for nations.

> Brainstorm weird and wonderful locations: pockets of tundra in the center of the desert, rivers that run uphill, great floating ziggurats that hover over an everspinning whirlpool. All that work you’ve done making sure that the rest of the world hangs together means that these features will seem all the more fantastical. They’ll be the wonders of your fantasy world, locations that nations will vie over for control. Sprinkle them around, especially in places that your players are unlikely to travel to. Outlandish names and reputations will spark your players’ imaginations and make them want to expand their horizons.

## Tribes and city states

> Identify the tribe’s headman, matriarch, shaman, or ruler. Identify the tribe’s immediate goals or enemies. And identify their system of reward and punishment. Building that society makes it easy to see who would give out quests and rewards for accomplishment, who might be banished and why, and who the tribe fears. Those things are generally enough to place the tribe in a larger context.

> Every city, in other words, is defined by how its people act, whether it’s well and generously and honestly, or when they are under pressure, threatened, or cruel. Make it clear what attracts people to the city-state, or why it has become less attractive, and show that citizens can vote with their feet in extremis. Make the city come alive by the stereotypes and repetition of certain patterns of behavior

**On nations**

> This means two things for game design: it means that you need to know what the ideals, values, and principles of the nation are, and also how they are subverted or upheld far from the center. How does the king communicate with his vassals? How does the goddess-queen receive tribute and celebrate her victories? Who represents the rulers along the border? What do the nobles want, and are they getting it from the existing order? Is the kingdom peaceful, threatened, or rotting from within? Choose at least two points of conflict, and write those down for the nation. I’d recommend one conflict within the national borders, and one conflict between the nation and some other group: a neighboring nation, nomads, a secret society, or maybe a dragon in the mountains that is the nation’s nemesis. A nation with no conflicts within itself or with external nations is a wonderful place to live, peaceful and prosperous—and boring for gaming or narrative. I would not spend too much of your valuable design time on dull locations with few promising avenues for adventure. Once you have at least two sources of conflict for your nation, figure out how those conflicts appear in everyday life that characters might see. If the king is a good ruler and taxes are spent well on worthy causes, then perhaps the heir is dissatisfied and vain and seeks power through encouraging banditry and gathering young barons to his cause. Or perhaps a curse afflicts the kingdom’s rulers, such that the throne is never held for long, and each king dies a horrible death.

**Empires are not nations** 

> From a design point of view, an empire is a patchwork quilt of tribes, city estates, and nations, with one of these nations being dominant over all the rest. That’s more a matter of applying techniques from the prior discussion than of creating an entirely new category.
> This need to conquer has several obvious and some less-obvious consequences in worldbuilding. The obvious one is a need for a large war machine and the ability to marshal the population for conquest, tribute, and then administration of newly conquered people and territory. The less obvious consequences are the need for cosmopolitanism and a need for extreme bureaucratic skill. Empires need to find ways to deal with both primitive and sophisticated citizens who speak dozens of languages and who share no common culture. They need to find a way to organize entire nations to fit into the existing imperial model of rule. And they need to find ways to feed and house a growing population of their own people, for the more successful an empire is, the longer its borders and the hungrier its many mouths become.
