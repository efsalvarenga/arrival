# Aivridyt, the Creep
***Also known as: The Purple Evil, Ghuse, Grezar and other names***

![Dramatis Personae Aivridyt, the Creep](../../_published/arrival/abridged.md#Dramatis%20Personae%20Aivridyt,%20the%20Creep)

## Ghuse, Glasrath Army General and Cleric of Algath

Ghuse, Cleric and Captain of Algath, goddess of life and death `NE, Life and Death, symbol: Black star on grey background`.

- Ghuse is a 50 year old male human cleric. He has very long, curled, golden hair shaved on both sides and golden eyes. He has rugged, dirty, black skin. He stands 177cm (5'9") tall and has a muscular build. He has a diamond-shaped, average face. He has severe scoliosis.
- He worships Algath the goddess of life and death. He has a bad joke for every situation.
- He wears a necklace with the same symbol tattooed in Nilperto. He says this is the symbol of Algath. 
- Ghuse would easily kill one or both of the other leaders for Gorthugke, to make sure he lands on the alliance leadership. If he needs to kill, he would make sure to use a weapon from some of the other cities, to avoid being incriminated.

Ghuse's Prayer
> I invoke the key and the gate, i summon the messeng'r to announceth mine own w'rds. I, awaketh, the high augurer of thy dreams of life and death, Algath. Taketh hence our pride, god of dusteth and dusteth, recognizeth the insignificance of this w'rld and humanity yond fears and rejects thy gift. But giveth us life, until thee giveth us death
