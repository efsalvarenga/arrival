# Danaska Maksilov

![|200](https://i.imgur.com/flD3Toy.png)


If characters talk to her (she’s highly suspicious of arcane characters and doesn’t tolerate anyone interfering with her work), she explains warily that she’s working toward perfecting a formula for prima materia. A character with a background in alchemy knows what that is (the primordial matter from which everything originates); a character with training in Arcana can attempt a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check to recognize it. Maksilov won’t explain it—she has no time to waste on random intruders.

If characters leave Maksilov completely alone, she does the same for them.

The resident alchemist who’s experimenting with the alchemist’s furnace is Danaska Maksilov. She was chased away from her home city of Khorsburg by a murderous mob after an experiment gone awry released clouds of maddening vapor that rolled through the neighborhood and transformed livestock and household pets into murderous oozes. As Maksilov fled westward, she heard rumors of the Scarlet Citadel and the legendary alchemical engine buried beneath it. She found the furnace idle and ignored, and she persuaded Cagoth-ze to let her study it in exchange for potions that could calm the voices in his head.

Maksilov has since devoted herself to figuring out the furnace’s workings and putting it to use. Guided by a few hints in scroll fragments found in the scriptorium, her progress has been painfully slow. Mostly she learns from trial and error.

Though Maksilov is a near-genius alchemist, she is also unimaginative, mentally unstable, and obsessed with oozes. Those three traits have severely hampered her progress. Mishaps in some of her early experiments (that she misinterpreted as unforeseen successes) produced ooze-like substances. She became convinced ooze was the key to reconstructing prima materia (the primordial building block of everything), and all her research has gone down that path ever since.

Maksilov’s greatest fear is that other mages and alchemists will steal her ideas before she can see them through to fruition. Cagoth-ze and Bastron are the only creatures she trusts. She might be willing to talk to martial-type characters and even to clerics and druids (with reservations), but her paranoia over intellectual theft eventually derails any conversation with a practitioner of the arcane. Even then, she has little patience for talk about anything other than alchemy and oozes.

Her companion Bastronombecqua (“Bastron”) is a quasit. It was generated spontaneously inside the furnace during a transmutation that was a failure in all other respects. Bastron is technically a demon but it has never been to the Abyss or spent any time around other demons. It knows nothing about anything except the alchemist’s furnace and the first, second, and third layers of the Scarlet Citadel. It is entirely loyal to Maksilov, its creator.
