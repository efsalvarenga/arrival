# Ushulx
***Cultist of Curcharn***

![](https://i.imgur.com/wxLL7d3.png)


## Background

-   Ushulx aids the Gaoler just enough to keep him from turning against her. In exchange, he hands his victims over to her when they are on death’s door so she can sacrifice their last whispers of life to Curcharn.
-   Ushulx helping the characters doesn’t mean she’s had a change of heart about her evil ways. She sees the Gaoler and Scar as liabilities. In exchange for her help, Ushulx wants to be left alone.
-   In the end, Ushulx wants the characters dead, and she’s certain they’ll be killed if they proceed to deeper levels. Helping them head down to the arcane scriptorium or into the crypts is her way of sending them to their deaths. If the characters are disrespectful or try to bully her, Ushulx warns Cagoth-ze that intruders are on the way (assuming she isn’t killed in the crypts).

After meeting the characters Ushulx now likes them, as she thinks they are necromancers.

## Conversation guide

**Generic**
- [x] She notices that Miraak is an undead and praise for such a great work - she thinks the PCs are into necromancy and will be very curious with it.
- [x] Ushulx is a blood cultist who venerates [Curcharn](../context/religions.md#Curcharn) in the domain of death.

**Castle lore**
- [x] Tells characters how to reach the staircase down (Area 112)
- [ ] The surface access is through the shrine's ruined tunnel on the NW, through a magic door
- [x] She can show the vertical map of the first 3 levels of the castle
- [x] Ally of Cagoth-ze, who she thinks is a goblin, and is very smart and developing time magic
- [x] Not very friendly with Danaska Maksilov (the Ooze thing is disgusting)
- [x] She is afraid of Gellerth
- [x] Warns them the crypts are extremely dangerous, but she would go with them if they are inclined - she's always wanted to explore them but it was too dangerous to do so alone
- [ ] Many believe the halls of the Holzander Castle is dead or stagnant or stationary. They couldn’t be more wrong. Things are happening on every level of the vast ruin. It is a living world down beneath.
- [ ] [Curcharn](../context/religions.md#Curcharn) is the God of Death, Master of the Rivers Styx and Lethe, Guardian of Souls, Watcher at the Door, Patron of Sailors and Gravediggers
- [ ] Curcharn oversees the passage of souls: at birth, at death, and in the afterlife, maintaining the proper steps along the natural roads. He protects planar travelers, especially mortals, from demons and celestials alike. The god uses the undead as tools and servants, though he sees them as the damaged shells of his charges, holding only a few scattered memories.
- [ ] She perceives the river as a metaphor for blood flowing through arteries and believes Charun is connected to the Deadecho because of the proximity of this shrine to the crypt (Areas 116–120) and its connection to the dry lands.
- [ ] This philosophy is heretical both in mainstream views of Charun and in most blood cults, which is why Ushulx skulks here beneath the Scarlet Citadel.
- [ ] The statue was created and placed here by the elves before the coming of the Holzangers. It has two magical properties: one was instilled centuries ago by the elves, the other by Cagoth-ze and Ushulx working together.
- [ ] Another powerful wizard resides in the chambers below the dungeon named Cagoth-ze – Twister of Time.
- [ ] Cagoth-ze is a powerful wizard but completely obsessed with acquiring knowledge of the elves who used to be here. The elves managed to hide their lore not in a place, but in a time, and that steered Cagoth-ze into the twisted practice of Time Magic. It’s amazing he hasn’t torn himself into pieces spread over thousands of years practicing this type of heretical magic.

**World lore**
- [x]  She is searching for Aivridyt, the creep, the red dragon who a legend say was blessed into a deep death dragon by Algath herself
- [ ]  A fire demon knight is the messenger between Gellert and the high septon of Mondendovil, the Forefather
- [ ]  The FFKA have interrogated her once in a visit to Red Tower - they are desperate to know the entrance to the Ammuinoth
- [ ]  If asked about the FFKA and their understanding of the castle: She believes the FFKA do not know the access, but keep trying to find - and they are close.
