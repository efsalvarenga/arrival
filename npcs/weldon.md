- D6 roll: 1 & 2 Weldon is in the Castle of Bells calm (human form), 3 & 4 he is not in, 5 he is in and very nervous (glabro, hispo or bear form), 6 he is in and chained - completely out of control (in crinos form).
- Weldon is 2m tall in human form, 2.7m in bear form and 3.4m in crinos form.
- Weldon is an old sailor, from somewhere in the Foucheresia, who has been cursed with lycanthropy when a werebear in frenesi attacked and killed his entire family about 17 years ago.
- He turns into an uncontrolled crinos werebear (CR5) during full moons and when earth energies are aligned with celestial bodies.
- To protect civilisation around him Weldon ran away to the Ghost Domain and, 5 years ago took lair in the Castle of Bells. Whenever he feels he will get into frenzy again he attempts to go to the Ghost Domain or he chains himself with silver chains that can be found in the sepulchre room.
- Weldon does not remember the last few weeks (immense frenzy) as he had run to the Ghost Domain.
