- name: Impeding treachery
  desc: They are about to be betrayed in an impressively spectacular fashion. Some
    person or cause that they trust and rely on is about to ruin their plans with
    well- timed treachery, plundering them of some valuable resource or killing some
    vital ally. Hints may already be afoot, but they refuse to admit the possibility.
    Conversely, they might be the ones doing the betraying. They may be a vital lieutenant
    to a greater power, or a well-loved companion to a trusting superior. Theyâ€™ve
    performed services enough to justify the great trust they hold, even if their
    true intentions may not be so faithful. Something inherent in their other character
    tag may well be driving them to do this, whether or not they want to turn traitor.
