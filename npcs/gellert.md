# Gellert Holzander
***The Gruesome***

> [!quote] Quotes
> I don’t always use this entry, but a properly crafted quote can be a very effective way to quickly capture the NPC’s unique voice. Generally speaking, though, all you want is a single sentence. You should be able to basically glance at it and grok the voice. (Special exception if the character’s voice is “rambling old man”.)

> [!danger] Manneirism and visual aspects

> [!info] Background
>  As the only living scion of the Holzanger family, Gellert has authority over the land around the Scarlet Citadel and responsibilities toward its inhabitants. He ignores all of that unfortunately, and always has, in favor of pursuing knowledge and power at what he considers the most consequential magical site in all of Midgard, and coincidentally his own ancestral basement: the deep dungeon beneath the citadel.
> 
> Gellert isn’t insane or obsessed, but he is deeply antisocial and misanthropic. He has no interest in or use for other people beyond whatever service they can render him. He meets with Imortra the Debased occasionally and shares glimpses of his research with her because he needs someone to keep an eye on matters elsewhere in the catacombs. His interest in her begins and ends with his own security.
> 
> He has even less interest in other people. Crusading adventurers present an interesting puzzle: how can their deaths contribute to Gellert’s store of knowledge?
> 
> His appellation “the Gruesome” was applied by locals as something of a joke. Since no one ever saw him, stories sprang up that he was horribly disfigured. His scars were blamed on a magical experiment gone wrong or on being dunked in the Black River by his father moments after his birth. In fact, Gellert might have been handsome in his youth. Decades of living underground in the intense magical fluctuations of nearby ley lines have left him with pasty, flaccid flesh, glazed eyes, and skin lesions that never heal. He now deserves to be called gruesome, but the irony is that no one aside from Imortra has ever seen him this way.
> 
> Although Void magic spells are generally restricted to wizards, Gellert’s close ties to the Void give him access to knowledge that’s denied to other sorcerers.
