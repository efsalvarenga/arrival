After a day is passed, roll the die and in a 1 or 2, reduce the die size.<br>- Party tries to negotiate with the Deepfolk<br>	- There are lost treasures on the clacking caverns that they would like to have.<br>	- One of these treasures is Kimbarak's Helm<br>- Deepfolk want Kimbarak's hands<br>	- One small unit will follow the PCs for it.
