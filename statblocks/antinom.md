    desc: "As a Main Action, an Antinom can silently curse a visible creature. This curse can vary in effect, but usually amounts to one of the following results: the next 1d6 attacks it suffers automatically hit it; its next skill check is a catastrophic failure; it automatically fails its next saving throw; it suffers 2d6 damage from some random accident within the next five minutes; it contracts a creeping illness that has a 30% chance of killing it within a week; or it suffers exhaustion that adds 1d6 System Strain to its total, up to the maximum. A successful Physical saving throw can fend off the curse and an Extirpate Arcana spell can negate it, but a target is not neces- sarily aware that it has been cursed unless the magic is somehow detected."
