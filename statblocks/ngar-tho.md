*Based on the Shibboleth from Silent Legions and the Mind Flayer from 5e's Monsters Manual.*

The Ngar'tho are a horrific race of **alien intruders** that are quite literally unnameable to ordinary men and women. They have been living in the Latter Earth since the early ages of human development. They come in a humanoid shape (2 meters tall), and require constant moist to keep alive, fearing drier lands. Most of their **communication is telepathic**. These creatures admire beings who can feel pain, as they cannot themselves.

**Unacknowledged Truth**: The particular horror of the Ngar'tho is that **those who see them have significant difficulty to convey this knowledge to anyone else**. They cannot easily speak of it, or write of it, or even intentionally allude to the existence of the aliens or any of their activities, even if the monsters are directly in front of them. A victim can overcome this compulsion of silence by **pushing through it (costs 1d8 point of sanity)**. Once the compulsion is overcome, the victim may act normally toward the Ngar'tho for one week before the price must be paid again.

Ngar'tho can be found in small, isolated communities. **The natives are perfectly aware of the aliens’ presence, but can do nothing to call for help or even admit that anything is wrong**, even as their friends and relatives are taken and used for strange, foul purposes by the aliens. The Ngar'tho often **construct strange buildings and monumental edifices** in these communities, ones that the locals can’t acknowledge even when they pass by them each day. Any foreigner who arrives and sees these structures is likewise struck dumb by the Ngar'tho’s mental cloud, and most simply leave as quickly as possible.

Ngar'tho are also found in small 'tho hives. The hives organises themselves in shared intellect democratic states with unified authority. Most of these hives value domination, excellence and knowledge and desire to save themselves and survive in the Later Earth. These 'tho cities are generally located in deeps, which reminds the Ngar'tho of their home.

Ngar'tho are **not especially aggressive toward humans**, largely ignoring them save when some are needed for various terrible purposes. **Many Ngar'tho see humans as terrifying beasts**.

Those who are able to get away from the Ngar'tho usually try to rationalise them as hallucinations or mental breakdowns. Those few souls who have been able to resist the effect long enough to write about them are derided as lunatics and fabulists. After all, everyone who has gone to these supposed nests of alien intrusion report that nothing at all is out of the ordinary there. 

**The Mercian sorcerers draw knowledge from the Ngar'tho**, and it is speculated that Ngar'tho's technology was responsible for the creation of the Made Gods.

**Each Ngar'tho has 1d4+1 Evourecs attached to its body** that can be dropped for controlling creatures.

**Evourec**
***CR 1/4***

- Long jump: Evourecs attack by jumping onto creature faces.
- Attachment: Upon hit, on a failed DEX, the evourec attaches to the spine of its target
- Mind control: Upon attaching, on a failed INT, the target walks towards the Ngar'tho hive (or the closest Ngar'tho) for further instructions.
