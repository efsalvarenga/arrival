The Ngar'tho are a horrific race of alien intruders that are quite literally unnameable to ordinary men and women. They come in a wide variety of monstrous shapes, usually insectile or octopoidal in nature, most somewhat larger than a human being. They do not understandably communicate with humans, though they seem to be capable of coordinating among themselves.

The particular horror of the Ngar'tho is that those who see them either live or on video recordings are completely unable to convey this knowledge to anyone else. They cannot speak of it, or write of it, or even intentionally allude to the existence of the aliens or any of their activities, even if the monsters are directly in front of them. To even defend themselves requires a Mental Effect saving throw which may be rerolled at the start of each round until a success is achieved. Such victims may then fight back until the Ngar'tho is no longer visible.

A victim can overcome this compulsion of silence by pushing through it, suffering 1d10 Madness in the process. Once the compulsion is overcome, the victim may act normally toward the Ngar'tho for one week before the price must be paid again. NPCs almost never have the strength of will to make this mental sacrifice.

Ngar'tho are usually found in small, isolated communities. The natives are perfectly aware of the aliens’ presence, but can do nothing to call for help or even admit that anything is wrong, even as their friends and relatives are taken and used for strange, foul purposes by the aliens.

The Ngar'tho often construct strange buildings and monumental edifices in these communities, ones that the locals can’t acknowledge even when they pass by them each day. Any outsider who arrives and sees these structures is likewise struck dumb by the Ngar'tho’s mental cloud, and most simply leave as quickly as possible.

Those who are able to get away from the Ngar'tho usually try to rationalize them as hallucinations or mental breakdowns. Those few souls who have been able to resist the effect long enough to write about them are derided as lunatics and fabulists. After all, everyone who has gone to these supposed nests of alien intrusion report that nothing at all is out of the ordinary there.

Ngar'tho are not especially aggressive toward humans, largely ignoring them save when some are needed for various terrible purposes. When engaged in combat, they will usually fight with pincers or tentacles, though some use alien devices. Their technology is powerful, but rapidly degrades into powder when separated from its owner.

Each Ngar'tho has 1d4+1 Evourecs attached to its body that can be dropped for controling creatures.

- Long jump: Evourecs attack by jumping onto creature faces.
- Attachment: Upon hit, on a failed DEX, the evourec attaches to the spine of its target
- Mind control: Upon attaching, on a failed INT, the target walks towards the Ngar'tho hive (or the closest Ngar'tho) for further instructions.
