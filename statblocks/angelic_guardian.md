While among the least of angels, guardians are also among the most commonly encountered by Godbound who dare the ruins of Heaven or the fires of Hell. They usually appear as armored warriors wielding weapons that blaze with caustic light. Most are sworn to purposes that echo the Words of the Sword, Bow, or Endurance, and may take two actions every round.
