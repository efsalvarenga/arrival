The elite guardsmen of the empire. Royalty and archmages have units of these defending them at all hours. A unit of soldiers with ranged weapons is always close at hand. The praetorian guard are competent solo fighters and generally do not use swarm attacks. That does not mean they cannot do so. This NPC can screen up to 3 allies.
