Certain death-gods are capable of blessing their favored servants with eternal unlife. The“blessed dead” are those undead devotees who have earned this favor, existing for- ever in a twilit half-life that mimics their breathing days. Even so, some versions of this eternity are more pleasant than others.

The least graced dead are little more than zombies, largely mindless husks that serve their more intelligent peers. While they do not decay, their deathly appearance and chill flesh could never pass for living. More sophisti- cated dead have greater intelligence and free will, though they often bear the marks of the grave as well. Only the most favored and powerful dead can be mistaken for liv- ing humans, and these beings are almost invariably the abject slaves of their dark god. Should they be destroyed by violence, some such creatures can pull themselves back together over slow centuries, while others merely persist as dust and gore for the rest of eternity.

Blessed dead are most often found in the shrines and temples of their master, carrying out rites of worship and propitiation in an unending cycle of service. Living intruders are seldom welcome, though sacrifices of warm- er blood are sometimes needed. Intelligent dead are ca- pable of making bargains with the living and directing their mindless thralls to more complex ends, but few of the blessed dead have any further use for mortal concerns.
